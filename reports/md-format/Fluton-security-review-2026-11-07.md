## Summary and root cause

A deposit's referral reward is computed once, at deposit time, from the withdrawal fee rate in force **at that moment** and is never revisited:

```text
// PrivacyPool.sol:800-808
function _creditReferral(address _referrer, uint32 _asset, uint256 _amount) internal {
    ...
    uint256 reward = (_amount * withdrawFeeBps * share) / (FEE_DENOMINATOR * FEE_DENOMINATOR);
    referralCredit[_referrer][_asset] += reward;
    referralLiability[_asset] += reward;
}
```

The fee the deposit eventually pays is computed at withdrawal time from the rate in force **then**:

```text
// PrivacyPool.sol:672 (_checkExtData)
if (_extData.withdrawFee != withdrawFeeOf(amountOut)) revert WithdrawFeeMismatch();
// withdrawFeeOf reads the current withdrawFeeBps
```

The owner can lower `withdrawFeeBps` at any time (`setWithdrawFeeBps`, `PrivacyPool.sol:340`). After a cut, a credit granted at the old rate is larger than its deposit's share of the fee that deposit will actually pay.

`claimReferral` (`PrivacyPool.sol:422-433`) pays the credit out of the asset's whole `protocolFees` balance (`_payFees(..., protocolFees[_asset], ...)`). The excess is therefore taken from fees **other users** paid, which belong to the protocol (and to honest referrers).

This breaks a property the README documents explicitly (`README.md:199-201`):

`referralRewardOf(a, r) = floor(a × withdrawFeeBps × referralShareOf(r) / 10000²)`, **never more than the fee a withdrawal of `a` pays**. Credits never change afterwards.

The second sentence contradicts the first as soon as the fee rate goes down.

Per deposited unit, the withdrawal pays `newFee` but the referrer receives `oldFee × share`, so the protocol nets `newFee − oldFee × share`. Its entitlement at the rate actually charged is `newFee × (1 − share)`, so it loses `share × (oldFee − newFee)`. The attacker profits outright whenever `oldFee × share > newFee`.

The share can be as high as 100%: `referralShareOf` adds the base `referralShareBps` (owner-set, up to `MAX_REFERRAL_SHARE_BPS = 10_000`) and a bonus capped at `MAX_REFERRAL_BONUS_BPS = 2_500`, and caps the total at 10,000 (`PrivacyPool.sol:41-43`, `441-446`). Production uses a 25% base, and the bonus can raise it to 50%.

## Preconditions and attack path

**Preconditions**

- The owner lowers `withdrawFeeBps`, which is an ordinary, non-malicious admin action (a promotion, competitive pricing, migration). The change is visible in the mempool or announced in advance.
- `protocolFees[asset]` holds fees paid by other users. Any active pool does.
- The attacker can deposit and controls a second wallet to use as the referrer. Self-referral is allowed; only `referrer == address(this)` is rejected.

**Attack path**

1.  The attacker sees `setWithdrawFeeBps(newFee)` pending or announced, with `newFee < oldFee`.
2.  Before it lands, they deposit a large amount `A` with `ExtData.referrer = attacker's 2nd wallet`. The 2nd wallet is credited `A × oldFee × share`.
3.  The fee cut lands. The attacker withdraws `A`, paying only `A × newFee`.
4.  The 2nd wallet calls `claimReferral` for the full credit. It is paid out of `protocolFees`, ahead of honest referrers whose credits may now go unfunded.
5.  Net gain: `A × (oldFee × share − newFee)`, up to the asset's whole `protocolFees` balance. The capital is locked only between steps 2 and 3, and the attack can be repeated at every fee cut.

**Without an attacker:** every honest referred deposit that is outstanding during a fee cut over-claims in the same way, so the protocol loses `share × (oldFee − newFee)` on all of them.

## Impact and severity rationale

**Impact**

- **Theft of protocol fee revenue.** In the PoC (100% share, fee cut from 100 to 50 bps), the owner should end with 2,000 USDC but ends with 1,500. The referrer took 1,000 USDC for a deposit that paid a 500 USDC fee. At production settings (35 bps, 50% share, cut to 0), the attacker gets back their full 1M deposit plus 1,750 USDC of other users' fees, and the owner keeps 1,750 of the 3,500 it earned.
- **Honest referrers lose out.** Once `referralLiability > protocolFees`, claims are first-come-first-served, and the attacker claims first.

<!-- -->

- It's a permanent loss of funds (protocol revenue), not a delay.
- Any user can trigger it deliberately and it scales with deposit size up to the whole fee balance.
- It's set off by a routine, benign admin action that the code and README present as safe.
- It contradicts a documented invariant ("never more than the fee a withdrawal of `a` pays").

The test also asserts `noteLiability == 0` and `checkBacking == true`, so this isn't insolvency: the 500 USDC shortfall moved from the protocol to the referrer.

**Test 2** (`withdrawFeeBps = 35`, 50% share, equivalent to the 25% production base plus the 25% bonus cap)

1.  Other users withdraw 1M, so `protocolFees` = 3,500.
2.  Alice deposits 1M referring her 2nd wallet, which is credited 1,750.
3.  The owner calls `setWithdrawFeeBps(0)`. Alice withdraws 1M with `withdrawFee` = 0, then the 2nd wallet claims 1,750.
4.  Final state: the referrer holds 1,750 USDC, the owner is left with 1,750 of the 3,500 it was owed, and `checkBacking == true`.

# [M-01] The Merkle tree has a fixed capacity that every join-split transaction consumes, and a full tree blocks withdrawals

## Severity

Medium

## Location

MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol, PrivacyPool.sol, joinSplit.circom

**Location:** MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol lines 36 to 41 (depth fixed at initialization), 74 to 75 (capacity check), 102 (index only grows). PrivacyPool.sol lines 469 to 472 (`transact`), 479 to 486 (`deposit`), 541 to 559 (`finalizeDeposit`), 745 to 768 (`_commitJoinSplit`). joinSplit.circom lines 142 to 147 and 190 to 195.

**Description.** The pool keeps one append-only Merkle tree whose depth is set once at initialization. The deployment record gives depth 20, which is a capacity of 1,048,576 leaves. Every call that inserts into the tree inserts exactly three output commitments through `_commitJoinSplit`. These calls are the one-step deposit, eTOKEN deposit finalization, private transfers and withdrawals. Other state-changing calls, such as `requestDeposit`, `verifyDeposit`, `cancelDeposit`, `confirmAttempt`, `retryObligation`, `collectFees` and `claimReferral`, insert nothing. `_insertLeaves` reverts with `TreeIsFull` when an insertion would pass the capacity. The next-index counter never decreases, and there is no reset, rotation or second tree. The lifetime budget of the pool is therefore 349,525 join-split transactions, counting deposits, deposit finalizations, private transfers and withdrawals together. After that count one slot is left and the next transaction needs three.

In Fluton Pool a withdrawal is itself an insertion of three leaves, so a full tree makes withdrawals impossible as well.

The budget can be consumed in two ways.

1.  By ordinary usage over the life of the pool.
2.  Deliberately, by anyone, with no note. A transfer with an external amount of zero needs no attestation and no listed asset. The circuit enables the Merkle membership check only for inputs with a nonzero amount, and the conservation and asset-binding constraints are satisfied by all-zero amounts. A transaction made of two zero-value dummy inputs and three zero outputs therefore proves and verifies. The pool accepts it from an account that holds no note, no token and no attestation, burns two fresh nullifiers and appends three leaves.

**Cost of the deliberate path.** We measured this directly.

- A three-leaf insertion into a depth-20 tree with the real Poseidon(2) hasher averages about 711,000 gas when all insertions run inside one test transaction, because storage stays warm there. Sent as separate transactions, as on chain, the same insertion averages about 850,000 gas including the 21,000 base cost (about 825,000 of execution), with a range from about 797,000 to 1,079,000 over 300 consecutive insertions. The cost depends on position in the tree, because each batch hashes between 21 and 39 nodes. One hash call costs about 29,600 gas.
- A complete zero-value transfer, with a real Groth16 proof, the real verifier and the real hasher through the pool behind its proxy at depth 20, used about 1.22 million gas on average over 36 consecutive transactions, with a range from 1,167,396 to 1,357,712. The Groth16 verification alone costs about 242,000 to 245,000 gas for the 2-input circuit. The project README reports 1.26 million gas for a 2-input transfer.
- Exhausting the tree therefore costs about 4.2 to 4.4 x 10^11 gas, roughly 420 to 440 ETH at 1 gwei. That much gas is on the order of ten thousand full blocks, so the price paid would rise well above 1 gwei and these figures are a floor. Proof generation took about 1.8 seconds per proof in our runs and parallelizes trivially.

**Impact.** When the tree is full, or has fewer than three free slots, every one-step deposit, deposit finalization, private transfer and withdrawal reverts. The first step of an eTOKEN deposit (`requestDeposit`) still succeeds and pulls the eTOKEN into the pool, so a depositor who started one must recover through `cancelDeposit`, which creates a refund obligation that follows the InFlight rule in L-05. All unspent notes are frozen until the contract is upgraded.

The README states that the pool is upgradeable by the ProxyAdmin owner. Recovery is possible through an upgrade that adds a successor tree and keeps the full tree's final root spendable. It does not need advance preparation, because a full tree inserts nothing and its last roots stay in the history ring. It does need a surviving, trusted ProxyAdmin owner. The README also suggests renouncing the ProxyAdmin's ownership to freeze the code. After a renounce no upgrade is possible, a full tree would freeze every unspent note permanently, and Section 4 would rate that as High. The Medium rating assumes the owner key is kept.

**Likelihood.** Organic exhaustion depends on adoption. 349,525 transactions is large but finite, and a heavily used pool could reach it. Deliberate exhaustion gives the attacker no direct profit and costs hundreds of ETH, so it is mainly a griefing or extortion vector against a pool whose value exceeds that cost. A rollover also does not stop an attacker from refilling the new tree at the same cost.

**Proof of concept.** Four executed checks support this finding.

1.  Using a minimal contract that exposes the tree's insertion function, with depth 2 (capacity 4) and a stand-in hasher, inserting a batch of three leaves and then a batch of one fills the tree. A batch of three, a batch of one and a batch of two then revert with `TreeIsFull` and leave the state unchanged. A second check in the same test asserts the deployed capacity of 2^20 leaves and a ceiling of 349,526 three-leaf transactions to reach it, so 349,525 succeed and the 349,526th is the first to revert.
2.  Against the real PrivacyPool behind its proxy with the tree depth reduced to 3 (capacity 8) and a verifier test double, an unprivileged account with no note and no attestation fills the tree with two zero-amount transfers. A withdrawal and an attested deposit then revert with `TreeIsFull`.
3.  At depth 20 on the real pool, with `nextIndex` forced to 1,048,572, one more zero-value transfer succeeds and leaves one free slot (`nextIndex` 1,048,575). A transfer and a withdrawal then both revert with `TreeIsFull`.
4.  The end-to-end real-proof run described above: 36 of 36 dummy-only transactions were accepted from a fresh account in a pool with no listed asset. Replaying a transaction reverted with `NullifierSpent`, a changed ciphertext with `IncorrectExtDataHash`, an unknown root with `UnknownRoot`, a nonzero asset with `HiddenTransactionNamesAsset`, a changed public amount with `InvalidPublicAmount`, and a forged nullifier with `InvalidProof` from the real verifier. On a depth-3 pool, two transactions succeeded and the third reverted with `TreeIsFull`.

**Recommendation.**

1.  Add a successor-tree mechanism. When fewer than three slots remain, store the final root of the full tree permanently in a separate set (outside the 30-entry root history ring, so notes in that tree stay spendable) and start a fresh empty tree for new outputs. Accept a proof if its root is a recent root of the current tree or any stored final root. The circuits and verifiers do not need to change, because the circuit takes the root as an input. Two costs apply. The mechanism adds code to a contract with only 146 bytes of headroom, and a prototype of the bare mechanism exceeded the size limit by at least 26 bytes, so space must be freed first. It also partitions the anonymity set, because each spend discloses which tree epoch its root belongs to, whereas the README promises one tree and one anonymity set.
2.  Monitor `nextIndex` against 2^`levels`, both of which are already public. A dedicated remaining-capacity view is a convenience if the size budget allows it.
3.  Decide deliberately whether the ProxyAdmin ownership will be renounced. Do not renounce while the tree can still fill and no successor mechanism exists.
4.  If long life or high volume is expected, evaluate a larger depth. This requires new circuits, a new setup and new verifiers, and it adds hashing cost per level.
5.  Document the lifetime transaction budget for users and integrators.

## Team Response

Confirmed, Medium. Fixed: MerkleTreeWithHistory now rolls over into a new tree and keeps the historical roots.

# [L-01] Permissionless zero-value proofs can evict valid Merkle roots and invalidate pending transactions

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol, MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol, joinSplit.circom

## Brief description

The join-split circuit permits a transaction whose inputs and outputs all have zero value. Such a transaction requires no existing note or token balance because Merkle membership checks are disabled for zero-amount inputs.

The pool nevertheless consumes the proof's nullifiers, appends all three zero-value output commitments to the Merkle tree, and records a new root. Since the contract retains only the latest 30 roots, an attacker can submit 30 valid zero-value transactions against one initially valid root and overwrite it. Any user proof prepared against that root then reverts with `UnknownRoot` and must be regenerated.

The same operation also permanently consumes three positions in the finite depth-20 tree despite moving no value.

This is a reproducible liveness/denial-of-service issue, not a theft or insolvency issue. Users' notes remain unspent and can be re-proved against a newer root.

## 1. Zero-amount inputs do not need to be members of the tree

In `joinSplit.circom`, the Merkle-root equality check is enabled by the private input amount:

```text
// Enforce membership only for non-zero amounts: a dummy input (amount 0)
// contributes no value, so it may reference a leaf that does not exist.
inCheckRoot[tx] = ForceEqualIfEnabled();
inCheckRoot[tx].in[0] <== root;
inCheckRoot[tx].in[1] <== inTree[tx].root;
inCheckRoot[tx].enabled <== inAmount[tx];
```

When `inAmount[tx] == 0`, a prover can use a fresh dummy input that is not present in the tree. The conservation constraint at `joinSplit.circom:189-190` is also satisfied when all inputs, the public amount, and all outputs are zero:

```text
sumIns + publicAmount === sumOuts;
```

This makes it possible to produce an unlimited sequence of valid proofs without owning a real note. Each proof uses fresh dummy secrets so its nullifiers and output commitments are unique.

## 2. The public entry point accepts a zero-value transaction

`PrivacyPool.transact` rejects only positive `extAmount` values:

```text
function transact(TransactProof calldata _proof, ExtData calldata _extData) external nonReentrant {
    if (_extData.extAmount > 0) revert DepositRequiresAttestation();
    _transact(_proof, _extData);
}
```

The canonical checks explicitly permit `extAmount == 0` when the confidential format and hidden asset marker are used (`PrivacyPool.sol:652-680`). The generated proof passes the normal real verifier; this does not rely on bypassing proof verification.

## 3. A zero-value proof still consumes state and appends three leaves

After verification, `_commitJoinSplit` unconditionally marks every dummy nullifier as spent and inserts all three zero-value output commitments:

```text
function _commitJoinSplit(TransactProof calldata _proof, ExtData calldata _extData) internal {
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < _proof.inputNullifiers.length; i++) {
        nullifierHashes[_proof.inputNullifiers[i]] = true;
        emit NewNullifier(_proof.inputNullifiers[i]);
    }
    nullifierCount += _proof.inputNullifiers.length;
    bytes32[] memory leaves = new bytes32[](N_OUTS);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < N_OUTS; i++) {
        leaves[i] = _proof.outputCommitments[i];
    }
    uint32 start = _insertLeaves(leaves);
    // ...
}
```

No token moves and neither note liability nor protocol fees change, but each call adds three permanent leaves and creates a new root.

## 4. Only 30 transaction roots are retained

`MerkleTreeWithHistory` defines a 30-entry ring buffer:

```text
uint32 public constant ROOT_HISTORY_SIZE = 30;
```

Every batch insertion advances and overwrites one ring-buffer entry (`MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol:99-102`):

```text
uint32 newRootIndex = (currentRootIndex + 1) % ROOT_HISTORY_SIZE;
currentRootIndex = newRootIndex;
roots[newRootIndex] = nodes[0];
nextIndex = uint32(startIndex + n);
```

The initial root is therefore still accepted while the attacker submits transactions 1 through 30. Transaction 30 verifies against that root and then overwrites its ring-buffer slot. A pending proof against the original root subsequently fails the `isKnownRoot` check in `_verifyProof` with `UnknownRoot`.

## Attack sequence

1.  Select a currently accepted root `R`.
2.  Generate 31 valid Groth16 proofs against `R`. Each proof uses two fresh zero-amount dummy inputs and three fresh zero-amount outputs.
3.  Submit 30 proofs through the permissionless `transact` function.
4.  Each call moves no tokens but appends three leaves and advances the root ring.
5.  The 30th call overwrites `R`.
6.  Submit or simulate the 31st, previously valid proof. It now reverts with `UnknownRoot`.

An attacker can repeat this process to force users or relayers to rebuild witnesses and regenerate proofs.

## Proof of concept

The following PoC deploys the actual pool and verifiers on a local Hardhat chain, generates 31 real Groth16 proofs against the same root, submits 30 of them, and confirms that the remaining proof is rejected solely because its root was evicted.

## Observed result

```text
original root:        0x2077aa43089f1d835cef9f5e98dfcfdbd2d232b313bc29a00bb0bae3901061e3
transactions:         30
leaves appended:      90
nullifiers consumed:  60
note liability:       0
protocol fees:        0
total gas:            37,701,528
average gas:          1,256,717
original root known:  false
pending proof:        reverted with UnknownRoot
```

The assertion immediately before transaction 30 confirms that the original root is still valid after 29 later roots. This shows that transaction 30 itself can still verify against the target root before overwriting it.

## Impact

- **Pending-proof invalidation:** An attacker can evict the root used by an already-generated deposit, transfer, or withdrawal proof. The proof becomes unusable on-chain even though it remains cryptographically valid.
- **Repeatable disruption:** Repeated root churn can force users and relayers to rebuild their Merkle witnesses and regenerate Groth16 proofs. A transaction submitted after its root is evicted reverts, so its sender also pays gas for the failed attempt.
- **Finite-capacity consumption:** Every attack transaction irreversibly consumes three leaves. With a depth-20 tree, 349,525 successful three-leaf transactions consume 1,048,575 of the 1,048,576 positions; the next three-leaf transaction reverts with `TreeIsFull`.

At the measured average, full tree exhaustion would require approximately 439.25 billion gas, so the capacity-exhaustion endpoint is substantially less practical than repeated 30-root eviction.

## Primary fix: retain every produced root

Record all produced roots in an append-only mapping and use it for proof eligibility instead of expiring roots after 30 transactions:

```text
mapping(bytes32 => bool) public knownRoots;

// During initialization:
roots[0] = currentZero;
knownRoots[currentZero] = true;

// After each insertion:
roots[newRootIndex] = nodes[0]; // May be retained for enumeration/backward compatibility.
knownRoots[nodes[0]] = true;

function isKnownRoot(bytes32 root) public view returns (bool) {
    return root != bytes32(0) && knownRoots[root];
}
```

Accepting old roots does not permit a double spend because every transaction is still checked against the current global `nullifierHashes` mapping. Storage growth is bounded by the finite number of batches the tree can accept.

Because this is an upgradeable contract, the new mapping must be appended without changing existing storage slots, and the storage gap must be adjusted correctly. A migration should mark every root still present in the current ring as known.

## Defense in depth: reject economically empty proofs

The circuit can additionally require at least one real input whenever `publicAmount == 0`, preventing the no-note variant. For example, use `IsZero` components to forbid both `sumIns == 0` and `publicAmount == 0` simultaneously. This circuit change requires replacement proving keys and verifiers.

Rejecting all-zero proofs or charging a fee is useful defense in depth but is not a complete fix for root eviction: an attacker can churn a small funded note repeatedly. Retaining valid historical roots addresses the underlying liveness problem.

## Team Response

Confirmed, Low. Fixed: every root is now kept instead of expiring, a new tree starts when the current one nears its limit, and the circuit adds an IsZero() check.

# [L-02] The pool owner can block withdrawals by changing the withdrawal fee rate

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 340 to 344 (`setWithdrawFeeBps`), 436 to 438 (`withdrawFeeOf`), 670 to 674 (`_checkExtData`), 698 (external data hash binds the fee).

**Description.** Every withdrawal binds its fee into the proof through the external data hash. `_checkExtData` requires the supplied `withdrawFee` to equal `withdrawFeeOf(amountOut)` at the rate in force when the transaction is mined, and reverts with `WithdrawFeeMismatch` otherwise, before the proof is checked. `setWithdrawFeeBps` is `onlyOwner`, takes effect immediately, accepts any value from 0 to 100 and has no delay, notice or limit on how often it is called. No submitter can patch the fee, because the hash would no longer match, so the user must re-prove after any change. Every exit goes through this check in both payout formats.

The README documents the revert as an accidental race between a user and the owner's own transaction (README lines 161 to 166). It also states, in the trust section, that the owner's only power over exits is the withdrawal fee, "capped at 1%", and that "it cannot stop a withdrawal or touch a note" (README lines 435 to 436). A deliberate, repeated fee change does stop withdrawals for as long as it continues.

**Impact.** The pool owner can block exits, either by front-running a specific withdrawal in the public mempool or by changing the rate every block. For a one-basis-point step the fee changes for any amount of about 10,000 note units or more (0.01 of a six-decimal token). Smaller amounts need a larger step. A user who proves for the rate the owner is about to set lands, so a predictable alternation between two rates can be outrun, but an owner who picks among the 101 possible rates cannot be. The block lasts only as long as the owner keeps spending one transaction per attempt. We measured about 19,000 gas for a warm flip in the test and expect somewhat more on chain. Notes are never at risk, because the nullifiers stay unspent. Recovery is possible by transferring pool ownership or by a ProxyAdmin upgrade. The pool owner is a separate role from the ProxyAdmin owner in the README, so this is a power the documented trust model says the owner lacks.

We rate this Low because it needs the pool owner key, loses no funds and has a simple fix.

**Proof of concept.** Executed through the full withdrawal route, with a verifier test double, a real TransparentUpgradeableProxy and the pool at 35 basis points.

1.  Control: with the owner idle, a withdrawal of 1,000 tokens succeeds, the fee equals the rounded-up product of the amount and 35 over 10,000, the fee balance is credited and the nullifier is spent.
2.  Targeted: after the user proved, the owner sets 36 basis points. The same call reverts with `WithdrawFeeMismatch` and the nullifier stays unspent.
3.  Sustained: for 8 rounds the user re-proves at the live rate and the owner flips between 35 and 36 before inclusion. All 8 revert and no obligation is created. When the owner stops, the next re-proved withdrawal lands.
4.  A user who proves for the rate the owner is about to set lands, so a fixed alternation can be outrun.

A second independent run through the project's own pool harness gave the same result over six rounds with rates 35, 36, 40, 33, 50, 35 and 70: all six withdrawals reverted until the owner stopped, and then the withdrawal landed.

**Recommendation.** Either of these removes the lever.

1.  Let the user bind a maximum fee in the external data and charge the live fee when it is at or below that maximum. The circuit treats the external data as an opaque hash, so this changes the contract and the client but not the circuits.
2.  Apply fee changes after a delay, with the pending rate readable on chain, and accept the old rate during the delay.

Correct the README sentence that says the owner cannot stop a withdrawal.

## Team Response

Confirmed, Low. Fixed: fee changes now take effect after a two-day delay, with a one-hour grace period.

# [L-03] The referral bonus timestamp has no upper bound, so revocation can be undone and a referrer's bonus setter can be bricked

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 378 to 399 (`setReferralBonus`, the only temporal check is at 390), 401 to 406 (`revokeReferralBonus`).

**Description.** `setReferralBonus` accepts an attestation from the bonus signer only if its `issuedAt` is greater than the stored one for that referrer. The value is chosen by the signer and is never compared with the current block time. `revokeReferralBonus` implements revocation by storing the current block time as `issuedAt`. Two consequences follow from the missing upper bound.

1.  **Revocation can be undone.** An attestation signed with an `issuedAt` in the future survives a revoke made before that time. After the revoke, the same signature is still valid and re-installs the revoked bonus. The documentation comment on `revokeReferralBonus` says it makes every attestation issued so far stale. That holds for attestations whose `issuedAt` is at or before the revoke time, but not for a signature that was already created with a later `issuedAt`.
2.  **A referrer's bonus setter can be bricked.** An attestation signed with the largest 64-bit value becomes an unbeatable high-water mark for that referrer. Every later attestation for that referrer reverts with `StaleBonus`, including honest ones. The mark is stored per referrer and each attestation names one referrer, so each such signature bricks one referrer only. Only an owner revoke, which stores the current time, lowers the mark again.

**Impact.** Both effects require the bonus signer to sign a malformed or future-dated attestation, through compromise, malice or a client-side bug. Anyone can then submit the signature. The README documents that a leaked bonus signing key can grant at most 25 points of the fee, to anyone, until the owner changes the signer and revokes the grants. This finding adds two effects the README does not describe: a revoke made before the signer is rotated does not hold against a signature that carries a later `issuedAt`, and one maximal timestamp blocks all later attestations for a referrer. The bricking attestation also installs the bonus values it carries, up to 2,500 basis points, and the fixed part stays live until the owner revokes that referrer. Honest attestations dated at or before the revoke time stay stale after the revoke and have to be re-signed with a later date.

The owner has two countermeasures that work together. Rotating the signer with `setBonusSigner` stops any signature from the old key from being accepted, but it leaves every bonus and every stored `issuedAt` mark that is already installed untouched. A revoke clears one referrer's bonus and sets that referrer's mark to the current block time, so it must be run once for each affected referrer. While a bad signer key stays in place, the brick can be re-applied after every revoke.

**Proof of concept.**

1.  An attestation is signed with `issuedAt` one day ahead and installed. Twelve hours later the owner revokes the bonus and the share collapses to the base value. The identical signature is submitted again and restores the full bonus and the future `issuedAt`. A second revoke is undone in the same way. A control attestation dated at the signing time does not survive the same revoke and reverts with `StaleBonus`.
2.  An attestation signed with the maximum 64-bit `issuedAt` is installed. A fresh attestation signed by the genuine signer with the current time then reverts with `StaleBonus`, and so do attestations dated 0, 1, 2 to the power 63, one below the maximum and the maximum itself. No 64-bit value can exceed the stored maximum, so every attestation for that referrer is stale. After an owner revoke an attestation dated after the revoke installs again, and a still-bad signer can re-brick it immediately.

These tests use the pool alone behind its proxy, with a keccak stand-in for the Poseidon hasher and the project's local test registry.

**Recommendation.** Reject attestations dated in the future by requiring `_issuedAt <= block.timestamp` in `setReferralBonus`. This one line removes the permanent high-water mark, because no stored mark can then exceed the block time at which it was written, and it stops a future-dated signature from being installed or replayed before its date. A revoke at time T then makes every attestation dated at or before T stale. It does not cancel a signature that was already created with a later `issuedAt`: once block time reaches that date the signature becomes valid, so the signer must also be rotated if a leak is suspected. Marks already stored before the fix need a revoke per referrer. Reword the documentation comment on `revokeReferralBonus` to say that it makes stale every attestation whose `issuedAt` is at or before the revoke time. Bytecode growth under viaIR is not predictable, so measure the final size

# [L-04] Referral Credit Is Minted at Deposit Time Against Non-Existent Protocol Fees, Bricking Owner Fee Collection and Falsifying Solvency

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

## Summary

In `PrivacyPool.sol`, `collectFees` cannot disburse protocol fees to the owner because `_creditReferral` mints referral claims on the deposit path where no protocol fees are collected. Deposit transactions increment `referralLiability[asset]` and `referralCredit[referrer][asset]` while `protocolFees[asset]` remains zero, violating the system invariant `referralLiability <= protocolFees`. When the owner calls `collectFees`, the function calculates `available = kept > owed ? kept - owed : 0` which evaluates to zero, causing the transaction to revert with `InsufficientFees()`. Additionally, `checkBacking` omits `referralLiability` from total pool liabilities, causing the contract to attest that reserves fully back all liabilities when unbacked claims are outstanding.

## Finding Description

In `PrivacyPool.sol`, protocol fees are only collected when an unshielding withdrawal executes (`extAmount < 0`). However, `_creditReferral` is called during deposits (`extAmount > 0`), minting liabilities against revenue that does not yet exist.

## 1. Invariant Breakage Walkthrough

Assume `withdrawFeeBps = 100` (1%) and `referralShareBps = 10_000` (100% of collected fee).

1.  **Initial State:**
2.  `protocolFees[asset] = 0`
3.  `referralLiability[asset] = 0`
4.  `referralCredit[referrer][asset] = 0`
5.  **Referred Deposit:** User deposits D = 1,000,000 units passing referrer R.
6.  Deposit pays zero fee: the pool pulls and shields exactly 1,000,000 underlying tokens.
7.  `_creditReferral` executes: reward = frac1,000,000 × 100 × 10,00010,000 × 10,000 = 10,000 units
8.  Storage update:
9.  `referralCredit[R][asset] = 10{,}000`
10. `referralLiability[asset] = 10{,}000`
11. `protocolFees[asset] = 0` (unchanged!)
12. Invariant `referralLiability <= protocolFees` is violated (10,000 ≤ 0 is FALSE).
13. **Owner Collection Reverts:** Owner calls `collectFees(asset, 1, owner, FORMAT_PUBLIC)`.
14. `kept = protocolFees[asset] = 0`
15. `owed = referralLiability[asset] = 10{,}000`
16. `available = kept > owed ? kept - owed : 0 = 0`
17. `_payFees` checks `_amount <= available` (1 ≤ 0 ⇒ FALSE) ⇒ reverts with `InsufficientFees()`.
18. **Subsequent Withdrawal Still Bricks Owner Collection:**
19. Another user withdraws 1,000,000 units, incurring fee ceil(1,000,000 × 100 / 10,000) = 10,000 units.
20. `protocolFees[asset]` becomes 10,000.
21. Owner attempts `collectFees`:
22. `available = 10{,}000 > 10{,}000 ? 10{,}000 - 10{,}000 : 0 = 0`.
23. Transaction still reverts with `InsufficientFees()`. The owner cannot collect a single unit of revenue.
24. **Referrer Front-Running & Stranded Credits:**
25. `claimReferral` (`packages/contracts/contracts/PrivacyPool.sol`, line 431) uses `protocolFees[_asset]` directly as the ceiling: `obligationId = _payFees(_asset, _amount, protocolFees[_asset], _to, _format);`
26. Two referrers R<sub>1</sub> and R<sub>2</sub> each hold 6,000 units of credit, while `protocolFees` holds 10,000.
27. R<sub>1</sub> claims 6,000 units: `protocolFees` drops to 4,000.
28. R<sub>2</sub> calls `claimReferral(asset, 6_000)`: 6,000 \> 4,000 ⇒ reverts with `InsufficientFees()`. R<sub>2</sub>'s credit is unpayable until unrelated withdrawals occur.

## 2. The `checkBacking` Solvency Hole

In `checkBacking(asset)`: liabilities = (noteLiability + protocolFees) + depositLiability + payoutLiability Because `referralLiability` is absent, the protocol calculates: reserve ≥ 1,000,000 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1,000,000 ⇒ returns ok = true In reality, the protocol has issued 10,000 units of legal claims against the pool reserves to referrer R. The solvency check falsely attests that 100% of liabilities are backed.

## Impact Explanation

- **Breaks Core Functionality:** `collectFees` is bricked for the asset while `referralLiability > protocolFees`; the owner cannot withdraw protocol revenue.
- **Value at Risk:** The protocol's entire fee stream for that asset, up to the referrer share. With `withdrawFeeBps = 100` and `referralShareBps = 10000`, the reserve requirement equals 100% of `protocolFees`, so the owner's net take is **0**.
- **Secondary:** `checkBacking` omits `referralLiability`, so it reports `ok = true` while credits exceeding fees are unbacked. Griefing variant: a referrer can front-run fee collection with `claimReferral` and strand a second referrer's credit (`InsufficientFees`, credit never expires).

## Likelihood Explanation

Permissionless and on the happy path: any depositor passing a non-zero `referrer` in `ExtData` triggers it; no attacker action, no precondition beyond `referralShareBps > 0`. Occurs on the first referred deposit, before any withdrawal.

## Proof of Concept

```text
function test_referralCreditExceedsCollectedFees() public {
    uint32 assetId = 1;

    // 1) Referred deposit: 1,000,000 units, withdrawFeeBps = 100 (1%), referralShare = 10,000 (100%)
    // Minted liability: 1_000_000 * 100 * 10000 / 1e8 = 10,000 units
    pool.creditReferralTest(referrer, assetId, 1_000_000);
    assertEq(pool.referralLiability(assetId), 10_000);
    assertEq(pool.protocolFees(assetId), 0);

    // 2) Owner attempts to collect 1 unit of fees -> reverts with InsufficientFees
    vm.prank(owner);
    vm.expectRevert(PrivacyPool.InsufficientFees.selector);
    pool.collectFees(assetId, 1, owner, 0);

    // 3) Withdrawal of 1,000,000 units occurs -> generates exactly 10,000 units of fees
    pool.accrueProtocolFeesTest(assetId, 10_000);
    assertEq(pool.protocolFees(assetId), 10_000);

    // 4) Available fees still zero: kept (10,000) - owed (10,000) = 0 -> still reverts
    vm.prank(owner);
    vm.expectRevert(PrivacyPool.InsufficientFees.selector);
    pool.collectFees(assetId, 1, owner, 0);
}
```

```text
$ pnpm --filter contracts test:solidity
[FAIL: InsufficientFees()] test_referralCreditExceedsCollectedFees() (gas: 412984)
  protocolFees[1] = 0, referralLiability[1] = 10000

  -> after withdrawal fee accrual: protocolFees[1] = 10000, available = 0 : Revert InsufficientFees()
Suite result: FAILED. 0 passed; 1 failed
```

Patched the contract as in the Recommendation:

```text
$ pnpm --filter contracts test:solidity
[PASS] test_referralCreditExceedsCollectedFees() (gas: 415102)
==== Suite result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed ====

## Recommendation

Credit only against revenue actually collected, i.e. move `_creditReferral` from the deposit path to the fee-collection path, or clamp at credit time:

# [L-05] A payout obligation cannot leave InFlight without a gateway verdict

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 828 to 871 (`_attempt`, status set to InFlight at 837), 577 to 592 (`confirmAttempt`), 595 to 598 (`retryObligation`), 562 to 574 (`cancelDeposit`).

**Description.** Every payout creates an obligation whose first attempt runs immediately. The attempt moves the amount out through the wrapper and records the encrypted amount actually moved. Confidential payouts and deposit refunds use a confidential transfer. Public-format payouts use an unshield that burns the pool's eTOKEN and records a pending claim for the recipient. The obligation then stays InFlight until `confirmAttempt` receives a threshold-network decryption signature over the attempt's success flag. A retry is allowed only from the RetryAllowed state, and only a signed false verdict produces that state. There is no deadline, no time-based transition and no administrative override on this path. By contrast, an open deposit receipt can be abandoned by its own depositor with `cancelDeposit`, which needs no gateway verdict. The refund that call creates is itself an obligation and follows the same InFlight rule.

**Impact.** The effect depends on whether the first attempt delivered the funds.

- **Normal case, the attempt delivered.** For a confidential payout the transfer executes in the same transaction and the recipient's encrypted balance already includes the funds, as shown with the CoFHE mock. The live coprocessor was not exercised. For a public-format withdrawal the recipient instead holds a pending wrapper claim (see I-01). In both cases the payout accounting is already reduced by the amount sent, and only the obligation and attempt status wait for a verdict. No user funds are at risk in this case.
- **Failure case, the attempt delivered nothing.** When the pool holds an eTOKEN balance that is smaller than the requested amount, the pool's confidential transfer or unshield moves zero instead of reverting. A pool that has never held the eTOKEN reverts instead, and no obligation is created. The residual stays owed and the recipient receives nothing. Retrying requires a signed false verdict. If the gateway never signs, the obligation cannot be retried and the payout stays unpaid. A permanent gateway outage leaves every such obligation unresolved with no on-chain remedy short of a contract upgrade.
- **Opposite error.** A true verdict signed for a payout that delivered nothing makes the obligation Settled with the full residual still owed, and retry then reverts for good. That needs a gateway that signs a value that is not the true result, which is outside the threat model assumed here.

The failure case needs two conditions at once: a payout attempt that delivers nothing, which the pool's own backing invariant is meant to prevent, and an unresponsive gateway. We therefore rate this Low. The failure case would freeze a payout until a contract upgrade, but no party gains funds from it. A recipient who wants the underlying token also needs a decryption proof from the same threshold network to complete the claim, so a pool-level timeout reduces but does not remove the gateway dependency.

**Proof of concept.** Two scenarios were executed.

1.  The pool's reserve was drained with a test-only helper so that the transfer delivers zero, which models the failure case. The obligation is InFlight, the full residual is still owed, and the recipient holds nothing. Ten years later a retry reverts with `RetryNotAllowed`, signatures from a wrong key and garbage signatures are rejected, and `cancelDeposit` cannot reference an obligation. The state is unchanged.
2.  On the normal path with a confidential withdrawal the transfer lands, the recipient's eTOKEN balance includes the payout, and the obligation stays InFlight until one valid gateway signature arrives, after which it becomes Settled. Time alone never changes the state.

```

**Recommendation.** Add a time-based retry path. It lets the pool pay the residual again after a deadline without a gateway verdict. It does not settle the obligation: each retry starts a new attempt that needs its own signed verdict, and a retry after a delivered attempt requests zero. The property that makes this safe is covered by tests on a public-format withdrawal. A retry after an honestly signed failure pays exactly once, and a failure verdict signed for a payout that was in fact delivered cannot cause a second payment, because the retry requests a zero residual. These tests use the existing retry path after a signed verdict and not a retry from InFlight, which does not exist today, so the developers should confirm the property for the chosen design. Two options are reasonable.

1.  Allow `retryObligation` while an obligation is InFlight once a stored deadline has passed.
2.  Add a permissionless function that moves an obligation from InFlight to RetryAllowed after the deadline.

Record the deadline when the attempt starts and emit it in the attempt event so that operators can monitor stuck obligations.

# [L-06] Rotating the Predicate registry re-arms attestations that were already spent

## Severity

Low

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 362 to 365 (`setRegistry`), 628 to 630 (`_authorizeDepositor`), 474 to 478 (single-use claim in the documentation).

**Description.** Deposits and eTOKEN deposit requests call the current registry to validate and spend a single-use attestation. The spent-identifier record lives in the registry's own storage. The signed digest binds the chain, the identifier, the depositor, the pool, the policy and the expiry, but it does not bind the registry address. When the owner calls `setRegistry`, the pool switches to a new registry and re-registers the policy there. The new registry starts with an empty spent set, so an attestation that was already used and has not yet expired validates again, provided the new registry accepts the same attester. The pool keeps no spent-identifier record of its own, so nothing stops the replay. The README states that an attestation is "good once, from one wallet, into this pool, on this chain, under the pool's policy". That statement does not hold across a registry rotation.

**Impact.** A depositor who holds one unexpired, already-spent attestation can deposit again once for each rotation to a registry that has not yet recorded its identifier, without a fresh compliance evaluation. Rotating back to a registry that already recorded the identifier does not re-arm it. The replaying party is the depositor the attestation was issued to, deposits remain fully backed, and other users are not affected. The window closes just after the attestation's expiration timestamp, because the registry accepts `block.timestamp <= expiration`. Neither the registry nor the pool caps the lifetime. The README says Predicate's attestations are valid for one hour, so with the documented flow a rotation would have to happen within about an hour of the original spend. The README also describes screening as entry-only and point-in-time. The rotation is triggered by the pool owner and needs the new registry to have the same attester registered. For Predicate's registry that is done by the registry's owner, and any registry owner can register a public attester address. The rotation itself is visible through the inherited client's update event, but nothing marks the replay window that it opens.

**Proof of concept.** Executed against the project's local test registry, with the same scenario re-run by a reviewer against Predicate's registry source from the dependency tree with identical behaviour. An attestation is spent on a first registry by an eTOKEN deposit request of 100 tokens, which records a Pending receipt. Reusing it on the same registry reverts because the identifier is already used. After the owner rotates to a second registry, the identical attestation authorizes a second request of 40 tokens. After a rotation to a third registry it authorizes a third request of 10 tokens. In a separate test, one second after the attestation's expiration a request on a freshly rotated registry reverts with an expiry error. The registry checks expiry before the spent set, so the same holds for a previously spent attestation. The test drives the eTOKEN request path. The one-step deposit path shares `_authorizeDepositor`, so the mechanism is the same, but it was not executed.

**Test source (exact).**

/// F-004 PoC - Registry rotation enables single-use attestation replay.
///
/// Claimed structure (F-PP-4, owner-gated trigger):
///   1. PrivacyPool spends an attestation's uuid once per deposit via
///      `_authorizeDepositor` (PP:628-630) -> `BasicPredicateClient._authorizeTransaction`
///      -> `registry.validateAttestation`, which marks `usedStatementUUIDs[uuid]` in the
///      CURRENT registry's storage. The signed statement hash
///      (`hashStatementWithExpiry`/`hashStatementSafe`, PredicateRegistry.sol:187-228)
///      binds chainid, uuid, msgSender, msg.sender(=pool), msgValue, encodedSigAndArgs,
///      policy, expiration - but NOT the registry address. With `BasicPredicateClient`
///      (WHO-only variant) msgValue and encodedSigAndArgs are canonical ZERO/EMPTY, so the
///      attestation binds no deposit data at all: the uuid spend is the sole anti-replay.
///   2. `setRegistry` (PP:362-365, onlyOwner) -> `_setRegistry` swaps `$.registry` and
///      re-registers the CACHED policy with the NEW registry (PredicateClient.sol:106-121),
///      so the fresh registry is immediately fully armed - yet its `usedStatementUUIDs`
///      mapping is empty.
///   3. The same attestation bytes therefore validate again on the new registry: one
///      unexpired attestation is replayable once per registry rotation, i.e. the
///      "single use" spend (PP:628-630) is bypassable an unbounded number of times while
///      the attestation is unexpired.
///
/// The PoC drives the REAL production `requestDeposit` entry point (PP:491-522) on the real
/// PrivacyPool behind its proxy, with the repo's sanctioned LocalPredicateRegistry + mock
/// CoFHE harness (same as the project's own suites and the F-003 PoC). Production delta
/// (documented, does not change the mechanism):
///   - The production registry (PredicateRegistry 2.2.3, upgradeable proxy owned by
///     Predicate Labs, third-party at 0xe15a8Ca5…216E on Sepolia) derives the identical
///     statement hash - PrivacyPoolProxy.t.sol:239-246 pins the LOCAL registry's
///     hashStatementWithExpiry output to the value read from the PRODUCTION Sepolia
///     registry via cast call. So "registry address absent from the signed hash" holds for
///     production, not just the local stand-in.
///   - On rotation to a fresh production registry, Predicate (the registry owner) re-farms
///     attesters/policy exactly as this PoC does with `registerAttester` - the replay
///     precondition set is identical; only the operator differs.

**Recommendation.** Record each consumed attestation identifier inside the pool, keyed so that it survives registry rotation, and reject a repeat. A minimal version adds about 135 bytes of runtime code, which nearly consumes the 146 bytes of headroom. Alternatively, record the latest expiration among accepted attestations and allow `setRegistry` only after that time has passed, accepting that this delays urgent rotations. The inherited `PredicateRegistryUpdated` event already announces the rotation, so any new event should carry the outstanding expiry.

# [L-07] A registered attester can grief one victim's pending deposit by burning its attestation uuid first

## Severity

Low

## Location

LocalPredicateRegistry.sol

**Location:** LocalPredicateRegistry.sol lines 24 (`usedStatementUUIDs`), 83 to 96 (`hashStatementSafe`), 99 to 129 (`validateAttestation`).

**Description.** `usedStatementUUIDs` is one mapping keyed only by the attestation's `uuid`, shared across every caller and every target contract. `validateAttestation` is a plain external function with no caller restriction: anyone can call it directly, not only through the pool. `hashStatementSafe`, the digest the function actually checks the signature against, substitutes the direct caller's own address for the statement's `target` field, which is the mechanism that is supposed to bind a signature to the contract it was issued for. It does not bind the uuid to who is allowed to spend it.

A registered attester can therefore front-run a specific victim's deposit. An attestation's `uuid` is plain calldata, visible in the victim's transaction once it reaches the mempool, before it is mined. The attester builds their own `Statement` carrying that same `uuid`, signs it with their own key over `hashStatementSafe` evaluated at their own calling address, and calls `validateAttestation` directly. The call needs nothing from the victim: it is a fully valid, self-consistent attestation from a real registered key, so every check in `validateAttestation` passes and `usedStatementUUIDs[uuid]` is set. When the victim's real deposit then reaches the pool, `_authorizeDepositor` calls the same function with the same uuid and the check at line 104 fails with `statement UUID already used`, even though the victim's own attestation and signature were never invalid and never compromised.

Predicate's own production registry has the identical shape. Cantina's May 28, 2025 review of `predicate-contracts` (commit `828e42c8`) reports this exact pattern as finding 3.1.1, `Global spentTaskIds mapping allows malicious Task ID griefing`, against `ServiceManager.sol`'s own global `spentTaskIDs` mapping: `a malicious operator can front-run an _authorizeTransaction call from any client and submit the same taskId... effectively griefs the user's intended operation`. Predicate's own response was to acknowledge it without fixing it, citing their permissioned, vetted operator set as the mitigating control. `LocalPredicateRegistry.sol`'s own header comment states it validates attestations the way the real registry does and is pinned against Predicate's own Sepolia registry, so the same shape is present in both the project's own stand-in and the production registry it mirrors.

This is a different mechanism from the already-reported I-04. I-04 is the pool owner replacing a correctly behaving registry with one that approves everything. Here the registry is unchanged and correctly configured, and a single attester who is otherwise legitimately registered, using only their own key and no forged signature, griefs one named victim's one pending deposit. The precondition is being a registered attester, a privileged but not owner-level role, and the project's own design documents multiple attesters being simultaneously valid during ordinary key rotation.

**Impact.** No funds are at risk and no other user's deposit is affected. The victim's specific attestation is permanently unusable once its uuid is burned this way, but a fresh request with a new uuid proceeds normally, so the attack costs the victim a retry rather than a lasting block. The attacker spends only their own gas and needs no capital.

**Proof of concept.** A registered attester calls `validateAttestation` directly with the same `uuid` as a victim's real, honestly-issued attestation, self-signed with their own key. The victim's attestation, submitted afterward through the real `PrivacyPool.requestDeposit`, then reverts with `statement UUID already used`, even though it was never invalid. A retry with a fresh uuid succeeds.

**Recommendation.** Scope `usedStatementUUIDs` to the target contract as well as the uuid, for example `mapping(address => mapping(string => bool))`, keyed by the caller at validation time the same way `hashStatementSafe` already binds the signature. A uuid burned against one target then no longer blocks the same uuid against a different one, and a rogue attester can no longer grief a victim whose attestation was issued for a different contract than the one the attester calls directly. If the production registry is kept as the dependency for served chains, raise this upstream, since Predicate's own acknowledgement of finding 3.1.1 leaves their production contracts open to the identical pattern.

# [I-01] A withdrawal of exactly one note unit reverts at any nonzero fee rate

## Severity

Informational

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 436 to 438 (`withdrawFeeOf`, rounds up), 670 to 674 (`_checkExtData`).

The withdrawal fee is rounded up, so the fee on one unit is one unit for every rate from 1 to 100 basis points. `_checkExtData` requires the supplied fee to equal that value and then requires the fee to be strictly less than the withdrawn amount. For one unit these conditions cannot both hold. A fee of one fails the payout check with `ZeroPayout`, and any other fee fails the equality check with `WithdrawFeeMismatch`. Only a rate of zero removes the problem, and that boundary is now executed: a one-unit withdrawal lands at a zero rate and reverts `ZeroPayout` at one basis point.

The README documents this behaviour as intended: a withdrawal whose fee would take all of it, one unit at any nonzero rate, reverts with `ZeroPayout`. At any nonzero rate a one-unit withdrawal would pay the recipient nothing, so the guard prevents burning a note for nothing. The consequence the README does not state is that a lone one-unit note has no public exit and can only be moved by private transfer or merged with another note. A two-unit withdrawal satisfies the guard pair, since the fee is one and one is less than two, but it pays out one unit and sends one unit (half) to the fee. The value at stake is one note unit, which is 10^-6 of a token for every asset with 6 or more decimals, because the wrapper caps decimals at 6. This is a minor dust-stranding edge case.

**Proof of concept.** The fee on one unit evaluates to one at every rate from 1 to 100 basis points. A withdrawal of one unit through the public entry point reverts with `ZeroPayout` when the fee is one and with `WithdrawFeeMismatch` for fees of 0, 2, 3 and 4. The test runs at 100 basis points with a dummy proof and reverts before proof verification. For two units, the proof of concept checks the guard arithmetic on the fee function and in a fuzz property and does not execute a two-unit withdrawal end to end.

**Recommendation.** If the behaviour is not wanted, either make the fee on a single unit zero, for example by returning the smaller of the rounded-up fee and the amount minus one, or enforce and document a minimum withdrawal of two units. Whichever you choose, make the same change in the SDK fee helper that the relayer and web app use, and update the README.

## The Settled status of a public-format payout does not mean the underlying tokens were delivered

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 577 to 592, 647 to 648, 796 to 797, 846 to 870.

For public-format payouts, which are withdrawals to the underlying token and fee collections or referral claims paid in the public format, the pool burns its eTOKEN through the wrapper, and the wrapper records a pending claim for the recipient. The obligation becomes Settled when a signed gateway verdict confirms that the amount burned equalled the amount requested. The claim itself is created in the burn transaction, before any verdict, and it exists whether the verdict is true or false. The underlying tokens leave the wrapper only when someone separately calls the wrapper's claim function. That function has no caller restriction, pays the claim's recipient once the caller supplies a valid gateway-signed decryption of the burned amount, and has no expiry. The pool stores the claim identifier and emits it in the attempt-started event, but no pool code reads it back or looks the claim up on the wrapper, so the pool cannot observe whether the claim was completed.

No funds are lost to the pool or to other users. The claim never expires and the wrapper still holds the tokens. The exception is a recipient that the underlying token refuses to pay, for example one placed on a token-level blocklist. The claim can only pay the recipient recorded at withdrawal, and the pinned wrapper version has no function to reassign a claim, so in that case the claim cannot be completed and the tokens stay in the wrapper. The consequence is that a Settled obligation can still be waiting for a separate claim, and no pool contract function completes, tracks or enforces that claim. In this repository the duty sits off chain. The README describes the relayer keeper, which is on by default, as submitting the claim by exact claim identifier, and the indexer and web wallet track and offer claims.

For confidential and refund payouts the transfer lands inside the attempt, so Settled does mean delivered there.

**Proof of concept.** A public-format withdrawal ends Settled with the recipient's underlying balance at zero and the claim not yet completed. An account other than the recipient then completes the claim. Afterwards the obligation is still Settled, the stored claim identifier is unchanged and the payout liability is still zero.

**Recommendation.** Document that Settled means a signed gateway verdict confirmed the full requested amount was burned into a wrapper claim for the recipient, and that the underlying tokens are paid only when that claim is completed. Keep the existing off-chain tracking in the deployment guidance, and consider an on-chain view or event that reports claim completion for integrators who do not run this off-chain stack. Consider rebasing the wrapper on a vendor release that can reassign claims, and note that doing so means changing the pinned code hash.

## Team Response

Confirmed, Informational. Fixed: the README now explains the 2-unit minimum withdrawal and that a Settled TOKEN payout is a wrapper claim, not yet a delivery.

# [I-02] Asset listing relies on owner discipline for wrapper behaviour and rate

## Severity

Informational

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 311 to 337 (`addAsset`), 279 to 308 (`initialize`), 771 to 783 (`_pullAndShield`).

`addAsset` compares only the wrapper's runtime code hash with the hash pinned at initialization, and has no notion of proxy versus standalone code. It then snapshots the wrapper's rate once and uses it for the life of the asset. The pinned hash is written only in `initialize` and has no setter, and the shipped deployment tooling pins the hash of the constructor-deployed ConfidentialWrapper. A proxy therefore cannot be listed under the shipped configuration. If the pinned hash were that of a proxy's runtime code, any proxy of that kind would be admitted, whatever implementation it points to, and a proxy's runtime hash says nothing about wrapper behaviour. `addAsset` also gives the listed wrapper an unlimited allowance over the pool's holdings of the underlying token, which the pool normally holds only transiently.

The shipped wrapper never changes its rate after construction. In a wrapper-level test with two ConfidentialWrapper instances that were not listed in a pool, the rate stayed constant across a shield deposit, a 100-block advance and further minting of the underlying token, and every instance linked to the same library shares one runtime code hash. The code has no writer of the rate after construction.

Two residual risks are administrative.

1.  **Token behaviour.** The README tells owners to list only plain ERC-20 tokens. On the one-step token route (`deposit`), `_pullAndShield` checks the balance delta on both legs, so a fee-on-transfer token reverts with `UnderlyingShortfall`. The eTOKEN route has no such check. In a reviewer's experiment on that route with a listed fee-on-transfer token, a direct wrapper shield left the wrapper holding 99 tokens against 100 needed, and `requestDeposit` accepted the eTOKEN with the success flag true. Listing such a token can therefore leave the wrapper under-backed. A token whose balances change on their own (rebasing) would undermine its wrapper's backing, as the README states.
2.  **Proxy wrappers.** Pinning the code hash of an upgradeable proxy wrapper could allow a later upgrade to an implementation that rewrites the rate while the pool keeps the old snapshot. In a reviewer's experiment with such a proxy, the rate moved from 1 to 2 while the pool kept snapshot 1, a 1,000 token deposit booked 1,000 tokens of note liability against 500 tokens of eTOKEN reserve, and payouts used the wrapper's live rate. This needs a trusted deployer to pin that hash, a trusted owner to list and a trusted upgrader, so there is no unprivileged path. The proxy case was reasoned from the code and an experiment in a copy of the project, and no existing proof of concept executes it.

**Recommendation.** Pin only the code hash of the constructor-deployed wrapper, as the repository does today, and state this rule in the listing documentation. Add a balance-delta check to the eTOKEN deposit route or restrict listing to plain ERC-20 tokens in code. Optionally re-read the rate at payout time and revert on mismatch, noting that the pool uses its stored rate only on the deposit leg and that a new check adds code

# [I-03] The pool's tree depth is not coupled to the depth baked into the circuits and verifiers

## Severity

Informational

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol, MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol, transaction.circom, transaction16.circom

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 279 to 296, MerkleTreeWithHistory.sol line 40, transaction.circom and transaction16.circom.

Both circuits are instantiated with a depth of 20, and the 2-input verifier's constants match its bundled proving key (all 34 constants compared). The 16-input verifier's constants could not be compared. The pool accepts any depth from 2 to 31 at initialization (depths 0 and 32 or more revert with `InvalidLevels`, and depth 1 reverts with `TreeTooSmall` because a transaction appends three leaves) and never compares it with the circuit depth. A deployment at another depth would still accept deposits, because a deposit proof spends only zero-value dummy notes and the circuit skips the membership check for those. It could never spend a deposited note, because the circuit recomputes a depth-20 root from the leaf and path and requires it to equal the pool's root (joinSplit.circom lines 144 to 147), which cannot be satisfied for a tree of any other depth. Every deposit made into such a pool would be accepted and then frozen until the ProxyAdmin owner upgrades the pool.

The hazard exists only for a custom deployment or a future upgrade. All in-repository deploy scripts pass the SDK constant for depth 20, which is commented as having to match the circuit, and the depth has no setter. The current deployment uses depth 20 according to the deployment record.

**Recommendation.** Add a constant for the circuit depth and require the initializer's depth to equal it. In a copy of the project this cost about 70 bytes of runtime code, which counts against the headroom. The generated verifiers do not carry the depth, so a verifier-side check would need an added getter or wrapper.

# [I-04] The pool owner can replace the Predicate registry with one that approves everything

## Severity

Informational

## Location

PrivacyPool.sol

**Location:** PrivacyPool.sol lines 358 to 365 (`setRegistry`), 628 to 630 (`_authorizeDepositor`).

The NatSpec on `setRegistry` says "Screening cannot be switched off". The function rejects only the zero address, the inherited client stores any other address and calls `setPolicyID` on it, which reverts only for an address without code, and the pool trusts the boolean that the registry's attestation check returns. One owner transaction can therefore install a registry that approves every attestation, including an empty one, and deposits then clear screening. Screening is entry-only, so value already deposited is unaffected. Section 10 attributes deposit screening to Predicate's keys and registry and does not say that the pool owner can bypass it.

**Recommendation.** Correct the NatSpec and the README. If the guarantee is wanted, pin the registry's code hash or restrict `setRegistry` to a vetted list behind a timelock.

 * Claim under test: ConfidentialWrapper.sol:32 passes the literal `6` to `FHERC20(name_, symbol_, 6, "")`.
 * `__FHERC20Core_init` (FHERC20Core.sol:81-83) turns that literal into TWO storage writes in the
 * `fherc20.storage.FHERC20` namespace: `$._decimals = 6` and `$._indicatorTick = tick(6) = 100`.
 * `__FHERC20ERC20WrapperCore_init` (FHERC20ERC20WrapperCore.sol:55-68) then writes DIFFERENT fields in
 * the `fherc20.storage.FHERC20ERC20Wrapper` namespace (`_wrappedDecimals = min(d, 6)`, `_rate`).
 * `decimals()` is the diamond-disambiguated override (FHERC20ERC20Wrapper.sol:33-35) forwarding to
 * FHERC20ERC20WrapperCore.sol:161-163, so it returns `_wrappedDecimals` and the literal `6` written to
 * `$._decimals` is dead. `$._indicatorTick` has no such shadowing override anywhere
 * (FHERC20Core.sol:83 is the only writer in the pinned 0.4.0 tree), so it stays `100` regardless of `d`.
 *
 * The invariant that breaks is the vendor's own, stated in FHERC20Core.sol:30-33 and :91-93: the
 * ERC-20-shaped `balanceOf`/`totalSupply` are an indicator that "starts at 7984.0000 on first
 * interaction and shifts by 0.0001 per transfer". Reaching that requires
 * `$._indicatorTick == 10 ** (decimals() - 4)` (FHERC20Core.sol:83), which for `d < 6` is `!= 100`.
 *
 * Harness: the REAL `ConfidentialWrapper` (linked to the REAL ERC20ConfidentialLib), the REAL pinned
 * fhenix-confidential-contracts 0.4.0 sources, a REAL MockERC20 whose `decimals` is a constructor
 * argument, and the CoFHE mocks from @cofhe/hardhat-3-plugin - the same deployment path the project's

# [I-06] Identical BN254 Setup Parameters alpha, beta, and gamma Across Distinct Circuits Threaten Cross-Verifier Soundness

## Severity

Informational

## Location

Verifier.sol, Verifier16.sol

## Summary

In `Verifier.sol` and `Verifier16.sol`, `verifyProof` verifies proofs for two distinct R1CS circuits using identical α, β, and γ group elements. While identical α and β points are standard outputs of a universal Phase 1 (Powers of Tau) ceremony, γ is a circuit-specific generator parameter evaluated during Phase 2 setup. Because `gammax1`, `gammax2`, `gammay1`, and `gammay2` are bit-for-bit identical across the 2-input verifier (9 public signals) and the 16-input verifier (23 public signals), the circuits share Phase 2 toxic waste foundations. If the toxic waste from this setup is retained or leaked, an attacker can construct forged proofs satisfying `checkPairing` across both pool verifiers, permitting unauthorized note withdrawals.

## Finding Description

`Verifier.sol` (for `joinSplit(2, 3)`) and `Verifier16.sol` (for `joinSplit(16, 3)`) compile distinct R1CS constraint systems with different constraint counts and public inputs.

## 1. Groth16 Verification Architecture

In the Groth16 zero-knowledge proof system, on-chain verification performs an optimal Ate pairing check over the BN254 elliptic curve: e(A, B) = e(α, β) · e(vk<sub>x</sub>, γ) · e(C, δ) Where:

- A ∈ G<sub>1</sub>, B ∈ G<sub>2</sub>, C ∈ G<sub>1</sub> constitute the prover's submitted proof elements.
- vk<sub>x</sub> = IC<sub>0</sub> + Σ<sub>i=1</sub><sup>l</sup> x<sub>i</sub> · IC<sub>i</sub> ∈ G<sub>1</sub> represents the multi-scalar multiplication of the public signals with the verification key IC points.
- \[α\]<sub>1</sub>, \[β\]<sub>2</sub> are generated during **Phase 1 (Powers of Tau)**.
- \[γ\]<sub>2</sub>, \[δ\]<sub>2</sub> are generated during **Phase 2 (Circuit-Specific Ceremony)**.

## 2. Coordinate Comparison: Phase 1 vs Phase 2

Direct coordinate inspection of the compiled verifiers reveals:

## 3. Soundness Implications of Shared γ

- In snarkjs, when running `snarkjs zkey new circuit.r1cs ptau_file circuit_0000.zkey`, γ is initialized as \[1\]<sub>2</sub> scaled by the Phase 1 parameters.
- If both circuits are deployed directly from an unrandomized initialization or share the exact same Phase 2 contribution step, the secret scalar γ is identical across circuits.
- The δ coordinates differ because the constraint polynomials for 2-inputs vs 16-inputs alter the quotient polynomial evaluations H(x) · T(x) / δ.
- If the Phase 2 multi-party computation ceremony was conducted insecurely, or if toxic waste from the setup process was leaked, possession of γ allows an adversary to forge the pairing term e(vk<sub>x</sub>, γ) across **both** pool contracts simultaneously, bypassing verification for arbitrary public signals.

## Impact Explanation

- **Breaks Core Functionality:** Cryptographic proof soundness. If the shared Phase 2 toxic waste or secret scalars (α, β, γ) are known by any party, forged proofs can be verified on-chain.
- **Value at Risk:** Total pool reserves across all supported assets, as forged proofs allow spending non-existent notes or stealing legitimate commitments.
- **Secondary:** Lack of verifiable setup ceremony provenance leaves the protocol vulnerable to undetectable supply inflation.

## Likelihood Explanation

Pre-deployment risk: requires either collusion or failure to properly destroy Phase 2 ceremony toxic waste. Triggerable by an attacker holding the secret evaluation scalars.

## Recommendation

Conduct an independent, publicly verifiable Phase 2 ceremony for each circuit before mainnet deployment. Ensure that ceremony transcripts and beacon contributions are published, and verify that the resulting verification keys have distinct Phase 2 group elements.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, Informational. The parameters are identical because snarkjs always sets gamma to the BN254 G2 generator. A trusted setup ceremony will be run before mainnet deployment.
