# [L-01] Global Deposit Cap Exhaustion Can Deny Deposits and Disrupt Swap Refunds

## Severity

Low

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `_shield()`; `GloamVaultSwap.sol` - `swap()`, `_deposit()`.

## Description

The protocol enforces deposit limits through a global outstanding-balance cap for each supported asset.

When `depositLimitsOn` is enabled, every new deposit is checked against the configured per-deposit and total deposit limits.

However, the total limit applies collectively to all users without individual allocations or reserved capacity for protocol-critical operations.

Consequently, a user with sufficient capital can fill the entire available deposit capacity through multiple legitimate deposits.

Once the global cap is reached, subsequent deposits of that asset revert until existing deposits are withdrawn or the configured limit is increased.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
if (depositLimitsOn) {
    DepositLimit memory lim = depositLimit[asset];

    if (
        amount > lim.perDeposit ||
        deposited[asset] + amount > lim.total
    ) {
        revert OverDepositLimit();
    }
}
```

This limitation also affects the swap router, which deposits swap output and refund notes using the same `shieldBound()` mechanism.

```solidity
function _deposit(Deposit calldata d) private {
    _approve(d.asset, address(vault), d.amount);

    vault.shieldBound(
        d.asset,
        d.amount,
        d.commitment,
        d.proof
    );

    _approve(d.asset, address(vault), 0);
}
```

The refund branch depends on this function:

```solidity
if (refunding) {
    if (available < r.amount)
        revert BadRefund();

    _deposit(r);
    _trySweep(s.asset);

    emit VaultSwapRefund(
        s.nullifier,
        r.commitment,
        r.asset,
        r.amount
    );

    return 0;
}
```

Therefore, the deposit cap applies not only to ordinary user deposits but also to the creation of shielded refund notes.

If a swap's withdrawal is executed separately and its funds enter escrow, an attacker who subsequently occupies the freed deposit capacity can potentially prevent the refund from being deposited back into the vault.

## Example Scenario

The protocol has a total USDC deposit cap of 25,000 USDC.

An attacker fills the available capacity using legitimate deposits.

Other users attempting to deposit USDC encounter `OverDepositLimit()`.

A swap refund that requires a new USDC commitment also encounters the same restriction.

If the original withdrawal has already been completed separately, the escrowed funds cannot be returned through that refund transaction until capacity becomes available.

The final scenario requires an integration test demonstrating that an external attacker can reliably obtain and exploit the required transaction ordering.

## Impact

An attacker can deny other users the ability to deposit an affected asset by monopolizing its global deposit capacity.

The same restriction can prevent swap output deposits and may temporarily block recovery of funds held in swap escrow.

Because raising deposit limits requires a three-day governance delay after setup, the protocol cannot immediately increase capacity to resolve the disruption.

## Recommendation

Separate ordinary deposit capacity from the capacity required for internal settlement and refund operations.

Ensure that swap refunds can be completed regardless of the current global deposit utilization, without allowing ordinary deposits to bypass the protocol's intended risk limits.

Consider implementing safeguards against excessive capacity concentration and monitoring deposit utilization to detect potential service disruption.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Low. Higher limits remove it for listed assets. The refund path gets fixed at the next router deploy.

**Planned remediation, not live:** The refund-path fix is planned for the next router deployment.

# [L-02] Withdrawal Proofs Do Not Bind the Applicable Fee Rate or Minimum Received Amount

## Severity

Low

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `_requireUnshieldProof()`, `unshield()`, `_withdrawFee()`.

## Description

The protocol's withdrawal proof verifies the validity of a private note and binds the withdrawal to a specific Merkle root, nullifier, asset, recipient, and amount.

However, the proof does not commit to the applicable withdrawal fee or the minimum amount the recipient must receive.

Instead, the contract calculates the withdrawal fee using the currently configured `withdrawFeeBps` at transaction execution.

Consequently, a withdrawal proof generated under one fee configuration remains valid if the fee rate subsequently changes.

This can cause the amount ultimately received by the user to differ from the amount expected when the proof was generated.

## Relevant Code

```solidity
uint256[] memory inputs = new uint256[](5);

inputs[0] = uint256(root);
inputs[1] = uint256(nullifier);
inputs[2] = uint256(uint160(asset));
inputs[3] = amount;
inputs[4] = uint256(uint160(to));

if (!verifier.verify(proof, inputs))
    revert InvalidProof();
```

The fee is calculated independently after verification:

```solidity
uint256 fee = _withdrawFee(amount);

deposited[asset] -= amount;

if (fee != 0)
    feesOwed[asset] += fee;

_pushAsset(asset, to, amount - fee);
```

The applicable fee depends on mutable contract state:

```solidity
function _withdrawFee(
    uint256 amount
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 bps = withdrawFeeBps;

    if (bps == 0 || feeRecipient == address(0))
        return 0;

    return
        (amount / BPS) * bps +
        ((amount % BPS) * bps) / BPS;
}
```

## Example Scenario

A user generates a proof for a 1,000 USDC withdrawal when the configured fee rate is 0.25%.

The user expects to receive 997.50 USDC.

Before the withdrawal is executed, the governance-controlled fee rate increases to 1%.

The same proof remains valid because the fee rate is not one of its public inputs.

Upon execution, the contract deducts 10 USDC instead of 2.50 USDC, resulting in the recipient receiving 990 USDC.

The rate increase remains subject to the protocol's governance restrictions, and withdrawal fees are capped at 1%.

## Impact

Users may receive fewer assets than expected if the withdrawal fee changes between proof generation and transaction execution.

This introduces a fee-slippage risk, particularly for delayed transactions or withdrawals submitted through relayers.

The maximum discrepancy is bounded by the protocol's configured withdrawal fee cap.

## Recommendation

Introduce an execution-time protection allowing users to specify the maximum acceptable withdrawal fee or minimum amount they are willing to receive.

Ensure that withdrawals exceeding the user's accepted fee tolerance revert rather than executing with an unexpected net amount.

Consider exposing the current fee configuration clearly to wallets and relayers before proof generation and transaction submission.

## Team Response

Fixed. The fee is capped at 1% and any raise sits in a public 3-day timelock, so the gap is bounded and visible in advance. We’ll bind the fee or a minimum received amount in the next vault’s proof.

**Planned remediation, not live:** Binding the withdrawal fee or a minimum received amount in the proof is planned for the next vault deployment.

# [L-03] Merkle Tree Capacity Exhaustion Permanently Disables New Note Creation

## Severity

Low

## Location

`IncrementalMerkleTreePoseidon.sol` - `insert()`; `ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `transfer()`.

## Description

The protocol uses a fixed-depth Poseidon Merkle tree with a maximum capacity of 1,048,576 leaves.

Each deposit inserts one new commitment, while each private transfer inserts two commitments.

Previously spent notes remain in the tree, and their associated leaf positions are never reclaimed.

Because private transfers can repeatedly consume new leaf positions without requiring additional deposits of equivalent value, a user can progressively exhaust the available tree capacity by performing valid private transfers.

Once the maximum capacity is reached, subsequent attempts to insert commitments revert with `TreeFull()`.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
uint256 internal constant DEPTH = 20;

uint256 internal constant MAX_LEAVES =
    uint256(1) << DEPTH;
```

The insertion function enforces the fixed maximum:

```solidity
function insert(
    Tree storage self,
    uint256 leaf
) internal returns (uint256 index) {
    if (!self.initialized)
        revert NotInitialized();

    if (leaf == 0)
        revert ZeroLeaf();

    if (self.nextIndex >= MAX_LEAVES)
        revert TreeFull();

    index = self.nextIndex;

    // Merkle tree update logic

    self.nextIndex = index + 1;
}
```

Meanwhile, every private transfer consumes two positions:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
    if (newCommitments[i] == bytes32(0))
        revert ZeroCommitment();

    if (commitmentSeen[newCommitments[i]])
        revert DuplicateCommitment();

    commitmentSeen[newCommitments[i]] = true;

    tree.insert(uint256(newCommitments[i]));
}
```

Approximately 524,288 private transfers would be required to fill an otherwise empty tree when each transfer consumes two leaves.

## Impact

Once the Merkle tree reaches its maximum capacity, new deposits and private transfers become unavailable.

Other operations that depend on inserting new commitments, including certain swap operations, may also fail.

Existing users can still withdraw through `unshield()` because withdrawals do not insert new leaves.

Although deliberate exhaustion involves substantial transaction costs, the same limitation can eventually occur through legitimate protocol usage.

## Recommendation

Introduce a safe mechanism for transitioning to new Merkle trees or pool instances before capacity is exhausted.

Preserve the ability to spend existing notes during migration and ensure that the transition does not interrupt deposits or private transfers.

Monitor tree utilization and establish operational thresholds for initiating migrations before reaching maximum capacity.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. By design. Robinhood Chain is at about 550 of 1,048,576 leaves. We'll monitor it and move to a new vault well before it fills.

# [I-01] Disabling Withdrawal Fees Prevents Collection of Previously Accrued Fees

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `_setWithdrawFee()`, `collectFees()`.

## Description

The protocol allows the owner to disable withdrawal fees by setting the fee rate and recipient address to zero.

However, the configuration process does not account for fees accumulated before the change.

The `_setWithdrawFee()` function allows the recipient address to be cleared whenever the new withdrawal fee rate is zero, regardless of whether outstanding balances remain in `feesOwed`.

Meanwhile, `collectFees()` requires a nonzero `feeRecipient` before processing any fee withdrawal.

As a result, disabling the fee mechanism can make previously accrued fees temporarily inaccessible.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function _setWithdrawFee(
    uint16 bps,
    address recipient
) internal {
    if (bps > MAX_WITHDRAW_FEE_BPS)
        revert FeeTooHigh();

    if (bps != 0 && recipient == address(0))
        revert ZeroAddress();

    withdrawFeeBps = bps;
    feeRecipient = recipient;

    emit WithdrawFeeSet(bps, recipient);
}
```

The collection function subsequently rejects the configuration:

```solidity
function collectFees(
    address asset
) external nonReentrant {
    address recipient = feeRecipient;

    if (recipient == address(0))
        revert ZeroAddress();

    uint256 amount = feesOwed[asset];

    if (amount == 0)
        revert NothingToCollect();

    feesOwed[asset] = 0;
    _pushAsset(asset, recipient, amount);
}
```

## Example Scenario

The protocol accumulates 500 USDC in withdrawal fees.

The owner disables fees by setting the rate and recipient to zero.

The outstanding 500 USDC remains recorded in `feesOwed`.

Subsequent calls to `collectFees()` revert with `ZeroAddress()`.

The owner must restore a valid fee recipient before collecting the outstanding amount.

## Impact

Previously accrued protocol revenue becomes temporarily inaccessible when the withdrawal fee recipient is cleared.

After the setup phase, restoring a valid recipient requires a new governance change subject to the three-day timelock, introducing an unnecessary delay in fee collection.

## Recommendation

Ensure that disabling future withdrawal fees does not prevent collection of previously accrued fees.

Consider preserving the existing fee recipient when fees are disabled or requiring outstanding fees to be settled before allowing the recipient to be removed.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Info. `lowerWithdrawFee(0)` keeps the recipient, so owed fees stay collectable. It only happens through `setWithdrawFee(0, address(0))`, and we won't use that.

# [I-02] Governance-Controlled Verifier Replacement Can Compromise Proof Validation

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `_setVerifier()`, `_requireUnshieldProof()`. **Severity context:** Informational - Administrative Trust Risk.

## Description

The protocol permits the owner to replace the main proof verifier through the governance timelock.

However, the verifier configuration process does not validate whether the new contract correctly implements the expected proof-verification logic or remains compatible with existing private notes.

Consequently, an incorrectly configured verifier may reject legitimate proofs and prevent users from accessing their funds until the configuration is corrected.

More importantly, the protocol relies on governance to select trustworthy verifier implementations.

If governance is compromised or intentionally installs a malicious verifier, the proof-validation mechanism may accept unauthorized withdrawal requests.

## Relevant Code

```solidity
function _setVerifier(
    address verifier_
) internal {
    verifier = IVerifier(verifier_);

    emit VerifierSet(verifier_);
}
```

Withdrawal authorization relies on the configured verifier:

```solidity
if (address(verifier) == address(0))
    revert VerifierNotSet();

if (!tree.isKnownRoot(uint256(root)))
    revert UnknownRoot();

uint256[] memory inputs = new uint256[](5);

inputs[0] = uint256(root);
inputs[1] = uint256(nullifier);
inputs[2] = uint256(uint160(asset));
inputs[3] = amount;
inputs[4] = uint256(uint160(to));

if (!verifier.verify(proof, inputs))
    revert InvalidProof();
```

The governance timelock provides a three-day notice period before changes can take effect but does not independently validate verifier correctness.

## Impact

An incompatible verifier can temporarily disrupt legitimate withdrawals and private transfers.

A malicious verifier installed through compromised governance could undermine proof-based authorization and potentially permit unauthorized withdrawals of pooled funds.

The issue represents an important administrative trust assumption rather than a demonstrated permissionless exploit.

## Recommendation

Establish a secure verifier-upgrade policy requiring thorough review and compatibility validation of replacement implementations.

Consider limiting upgrades to previously approved verifier contracts and requiring additional authorization for changes affecting withdrawal security.

Ensure that users receive advance notice of verifier changes and retain an opportunity to withdraw before potentially incompatible upgrades take effect.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. Known. We've built an owner contract that blocks it, and handover waits on an outside review.

# [I-03] Withdrawals to the Pool Address Can Permanently Lock User Funds

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `unshield()`, `_pushAsset()`.

## Description

The `unshield()` function prevents withdrawals to the zero address but does not validate whether the recipient is the pool contract itself.

When a user withdraws to the pool address, the contract verifies the withdrawal proof, marks the associated nullifier as spent, and decreases the recorded deposited balance. However, a standard ERC-20 transfer from the pool to itself leaves the contract's actual token balance unchanged.

As the corresponding note has already been spent, the transferred amount is no longer represented by a spendable note. The contract also lacks a general mechanism for recovering surplus ERC-20 balances.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function unshield(
    bytes calldata proof,
    bytes32 root,
    bytes32 nullifier,
    address asset,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
) external override nonReentrant {
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    if (amount == 0) revert InvalidAmount();
    if (spent[nullifier]) revert AlreadySpent();

    _requireUnshieldProof(
        proof, root, nullifier, asset, to, amount
    );

    spent[nullifier] = true;

    if (deposited[asset] < amount)
        revert InsufficientPoolBalance();

    uint256 fee = _withdrawFee(amount);
    deposited[asset] -= amount;

    if (fee != 0) feesOwed[asset] += fee;

    _pushAsset(asset, to, amount - fee);
}
```

The `_pushAsset()` function does not distinguish between an external recipient and the pool itself.

```solidity
(bool success, bytes memory data) = asset.call(
    abi.encodeWithSelector(
        IERC20.transfer.selector,
        to,
        amount
    )
);
```

## Impact

Users can permanently lose access to their funds by specifying the pool contract as their withdrawal recipient.

Although the issue requires an incorrect withdrawal destination, the affected note becomes unspendable, and the remaining ERC-20 tokens cannot be recovered through the pool's normal operations.

## Recommendation

Prevent withdrawals to the pool contract's own address by validating the recipient before processing the withdrawal proof.

Apply the restriction at the smart contract level to protect users regardless of the frontend, wallet, or SDK used to submit the transaction.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Confirmed, Informational. The SDK, app and relay already refuse this, and we’ll add the contract check in the next vault.

# [I-04] Timelock Allows Scheduling Shield Verifier Updates That Cannot Execute

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `_changeArgWords()`, `_setShieldVerifier()`.

## Description

The governance timelock explicitly permits scheduling changes to the shield verifier through the `setShieldVerifier()` selector.

However, the underlying verifier configuration function permanently prevents the verifier from being replaced once a nonzero address has been assigned.

Consequently, after initialization, the owner can schedule a verifier update, wait through the governance delay, and attempt to execute the change, but execution will always revert.

This creates an inconsistency between the operations permitted by the governance interface and the operations that can actually be executed.

## Relevant Code

```solidity
function _changeArgWords(
    bytes4 selector
) internal pure virtual override returns (uint256) {
    if (
        selector ==
        ShieldPoolCore.setShieldVerifier.selector
    ) return 1;

    // Other selectors omitted
    return 0;
}
```

However, the underlying implementation rejects replacement:

```solidity
function _setShieldVerifier(
    address verifier_
) internal {
    if (address(shieldVerifier) != address(0))
        revert ShieldVerifierAlreadySet();

    if (verifier_ == address(0))
        revert ZeroAddress();

    shieldVerifier = IVerifier(verifier_);

    emit ShieldVerifierSet(verifier_);
}
```

The prohibition appears intentional, as it prevents an already-configured verifier from being removed or replaced with an unsafe implementation.

## Impact

Governance participants may schedule changes that cannot be executed, wasting transaction fees and introducing unnecessary administrative confusion.

Additionally, incorrectly configured shield verifiers cannot be replaced after initialization, potentially requiring deployment of a new pool.

## Recommendation

Align the governance interface with the shield verifier's intended immutability.

Remove unsupported verifier replacement operations from the governance whitelist and clearly document that the shield verifier cannot be changed once initialized.

If future verifier rotation is required, establish a secure upgrade process that preserves the protocol's proof-validation guarantees.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. Harmless, and it will be removed in the next vault.

# [I-05] Expensive Zero-Knowledge Proof Verification Precedes Basic Deposit Validation

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`ShieldPoolCore.sol` - `shieldBound()`, `_shield()`.

## Description

The `shieldBound()` function performs zero-knowledge proof verification before executing several inexpensive deposit validation checks.

These checks include rejecting zero amounts, detecting duplicate commitments, and enforcing deposit limits.

Consequently, transactions that would inevitably fail basic validation still execute the comparatively expensive proof verification step before reverting.

This results in unnecessary gas expenditure for invalid deposit transactions.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
function shieldBound(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    bytes32 commitment,
    bytes calldata proof
) external payable nonReentrant {
    if (address(shieldVerifier) == address(0))
        revert VerifierNotSet();

    uint256[] memory inputs = new uint256[](3);

    inputs[0] = uint256(commitment);
    inputs[1] = amount;
    inputs[2] = uint256(uint160(asset));

    if (!shieldVerifier.verify(proof, inputs))
        revert InvalidProof();

    _shield(asset, amount, commitment);
}
```

The basic checks execute afterward:

```solidity
if (commitment == bytes32(0))
    revert ZeroCommitment();

if (amount == 0)
    revert InvalidAmount();

if (commitmentSeen[commitment])
    revert DuplicateCommitment();

if (depositLimitsOn) {
    DepositLimit memory lim = depositLimit[asset];

    if (
        amount > lim.perDeposit ||
        deposited[asset] + amount > lim.total
    ) {
        revert OverDepositLimit();
    }
}
```

## Impact

Users submitting deposits that fail basic validation incur unnecessarily high transaction costs.

Although the issue does not directly compromise protocol funds, it reduces transaction efficiency and creates avoidable computational overhead.

## Recommendation

Perform inexpensive validation checks before executing zero-knowledge proof verification.

Ensure that the protocol rejects obviously invalid deposit requests as early as possible, while maintaining the existing proof-verification security guarantees.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. Gas only, on failed transactions. We'll reorder it in the next vault.

# [I-06] Merkle Root History Storage Introduces Additional Gas Overhead

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`IncrementalMerkleTreePoseidon.sol` - `insert()`, `isKnownRoot()`.

## Description

The Merkle tree implementation maintains a root-history ring buffer that is updated following each successful commitment insertion.

However, on-chain root verification relies on the separate `knownRoots` mapping instead of consulting the stored root-history buffer.

Consequently, additional persistent storage operations are performed even though the history buffer is not required for on-chain root validation.

The implementation documents that the buffer exists for off-chain observability, making this primarily an efficiency consideration rather than an unintended security flaw.

## Relevant Code

```solidity
self.currentRoot = currentLevelHash;
self.knownRoots[currentLevelHash] = true;

uint32 newRootIndex =
    (self.currentRootIndex + 1)
    % self.rootHistorySize;

self.currentRootIndex = newRootIndex;

self.rootHistory[newRootIndex] =
    currentLevelHash;
```

On-chain root validation instead uses:

```solidity
function isKnownRoot(
    Tree storage self,
    uint256 root
) internal view returns (bool) {
    if (root == 0) return false;

    return self.knownRoots[root];
}
```

## Impact

Deposits and private transfers incur additional storage costs when commitments are inserted.

This overhead accumulates as the protocol processes more transactions.

No direct security impact has been identified.

## Recommendation

Review whether the root-history storage is actively required by off-chain services or monitoring infrastructure.

If the data is unnecessary, consider removing redundant storage updates and relying on existing root-validation state and emitted events.

If external systems depend on the history buffer, retain it and document the resulting gas tradeoff.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. Kept on purpose for off-chain use. Nothing reads it today, so we'll drop it in the next vault.

# [I-07] Missing Constructor Validation Allows Invalid Proof Verifier Dependencies

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DualProofVerifier.sol` - `constructor()`.

## Description

The DualProofVerifier contract receives the addresses of the withdrawal and transfer proof verifiers during deployment.

However, the constructor stores these addresses without ensuring that they are nonzero or correspond to deployed contracts.

Consequently, the verifier router may be deployed with invalid dependencies, causing the corresponding proof-verification operations to fail.

Because the configured addresses are immutable, correcting the mistake requires deploying a new verifier router.

## Vulnerable Code

```solidity
contract DualProofVerifier is IVerifier {
    IVerifier public immutable unshieldVerifier;
    IVerifier public immutable transferVerifier;

    constructor(
        IVerifier unshieldVerifier_,
        IVerifier transferVerifier_
    ) {
        unshieldVerifier = unshieldVerifier_;
        transferVerifier = transferVerifier_;
    }
}
```

The verification function forwards requests to the configured dependencies:

```solidity
function verify(
    bytes calldata proof,
    uint256[] calldata publicInputs
) external view returns (bool) {
    if (publicInputs.length == 5) {
        return unshieldVerifier.verify(
            proof,
            publicInputs
        );
    }

    if (publicInputs.length == 4) {
        return transferVerifier.verify(
            proof,
            publicInputs
        );
    }

    return false;
}
```

## Impact

Incorrect deployment parameters may render private transfers or withdrawals unavailable when the affected verifier path is called.

Since the dependencies are immutable, recovery requires redeployment and administrative reconfiguration.

## Recommendation

Validate verifier dependencies during deployment to ensure that the provided addresses are nonzero and reference deployed contracts.

Introduce deployment checks confirming that both verifier implementations are correctly configured and operational before enabling the associated pool.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. The live verifiers are verified and tested. We'll add the checks at the next deploy.

# [I-08] ERC-20 tokens sent directly to the pool cannot be recovered

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`contracts/src/ShieldPoolCore.sol#L309-L318`.

## Description

`sweepStrayNative` recovers native currency sent to the pool by mistake, but there is no equivalent for ERC-20 tokens. Tokens sent with a plain transfer (for example a user sending USDG to the vault address from an exchange instead of shielding) are not counted in `deposited` or `feesOwed`, and no function can move them. The Robinhood Chain and Tempo pools accept only ERC-20 assets, while the Base and Ethereum vaults also hold native ETH. The native-only rescue can recover surplus native ETH but cannot recover ERC-20 tokens sent directly to any of these vaults.

## Impact

User funds sent by a common mistake are permanently lost. Pool accounting is not affected.

## Proof of Concept

```solidity
function test_L03_stray_erc20_unrecoverable() public {
    _deposit(alice, PER, 1);
    vm.prank(bob);
    usd.transfer(address(pool), 1_000e6);
    assertEq(usd.balanceOf(address(pool)), PER + 1_000e6);
    assertEq(pool.deposited(address(usd)), PER);
    vm.expectRevert(ShieldPoolCore.NothingToSweep.selector);
    pool.sweepStrayNative(owner);
}
```

## Recommendation

Generalise the sweep to any asset. Allow only `balanceOf(this) - deposited[asset] - feesOwed[asset]` to be moved, to a fixed address, keeping the same rule that funds backing notes are never touched.

## Team Response

Acknowledged. We'll add a limited ERC-20 sweep in the next vault.
