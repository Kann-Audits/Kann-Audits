# [H-01] Locking module never takes custody of AET, so the lock period, early-withdrawal cap and emergency forfeiture can be bypassed

## Severity

High

## Description

The locking product promises that deposits stay locked for 90, 180 or 365 days, that only a 2-5% early-withdrawal allowance is available before maturity, and that an emergency unlock forfeits accrued yield (RFC-002 §1.2, §6, §8). None of this is enforced on-chain.

`deposit_locked` and `add_to_position` deposit through the bridge with the user's own signer, so the AET share tokens are minted into the user's wallet. The locking module only records the amount in `LockPosition.aet_amount`: no AET is moved to the locking controller, and `LockConfig.signer_cap` is never used.

```move
// Perform the deposit through MoneyFiBridge
MoneyFiBridge::deposit(user, amount);
```

The bridge's `request` and `withdraw` entry points are public and only check the caller's own AET balance (`moneyfi_adapter.move:216-218`). They have no reference to the locking module, and AET is a freely transferable fungible asset, so any locker can redeem their AET directly at any time. `GuaranteedYieldLocking` is not affected: it deposits with its controller signer and holds the AET itself.

## Impact

- The lock duration, the early-withdrawal cap and the emergency forfeiture cannot be enforced for any locking position, which defeats the product's stated goal of predictable liquidity (RFC-002 §1.2).
- Yield that RFC-002 §8.1 assigns to the remaining holders on early exit can be kept by the exiting user.
- The abandoned `LockPosition` stays on record: `get_user_total_locked_value` and `get_early_withdrawal_available` keep reporting value for it, and later `withdraw_unlocked` or `emergency_unlock` calls abort with `ELP_AMOUNT_INSUFFICIENT`.

No other user's principal is taken, since locking pays no extra yield (RFC-002 §2). The issue is rated High because the lock is the module's only security guarantee and it is void for every position.

## Recommendation

- Escrow AET in the locking controller: after `MoneyFiBridge::deposit`, move the minted AET into the controller (measuring the balance delta), or add a `friend`-only adapter function that mints directly to the controller.
- Track AET per position in the controller and run every exit with the controller signer (`signer_cap`) through a two-step request/complete flow (see M-02), paying the user on completion.
- Optionally, restrict the redeem paths used by locking to `friend` modules.

# [M-01] Only one claimant per MoneyFi processing cycle can withdraw, and anyone can block withdrawals with `withdraw(0)`

## Severity

Medium

## Description

Every user's withdrawal request is filed with MoneyFi under one account, the bridge's reserve. MoneyFi stores withdrawal requests per wallet account, so it sees a single aggregated withdrawal state for the whole protocol.

`withdraw_fungible` burns the caller's AEWT, always calls `vault::withdraw_requested_amount` on the reserve, and only then pays the caller a fixed `amount` from the reserve:

```move
// burn withdrawal tokens
let asset = get_withdrawal_metadata(reserve_address);
let from_wallet = primary_fungible_store::primary_store(address_of(user), asset);
fungible_asset::burn_from(&withdrawal_state.burn_ref, from_wallet, amount);

// this will withdraw all pending requesteed amounts that's available
vault::withdraw_requested_amount(&reserve_signer, token);

primary_fungible_store::transfer<Metadata>(
    &reserve_signer,
    token,
    address_of(user),
    amount
);
```

According to MoneyFi's integration documentation, `withdraw_requested_amount` withdraws the entire available amount and requires it to be greater than zero. Nothing links the caller's AEWT to their own processed request, so the first caller after each processing event sweeps everything into the reserve. Every other claimant's call then aborts at line 276, even though the reserve already holds their USDt, until MoneyFi makes a new amount available.

Zero-amount burns and transfers do not abort, so `withdraw(0)` burns nothing, still sweeps the available amount and pays nothing. There is no per-user claim ledger, and the `ECLAIMS_*` error codes declared in the module are never used.

## Impact

- Withdrawals stall protocol-wide: bridge AEWT redemptions, the second step of GuaranteedYieldLocking exits (`withdraw_guaranteed`, `withdraw_emergency_guaranteed`) and the locking exits. In normal operation at most one claimant per processing cycle succeeds.
- Any account with an AEWT primary store, which can hold a zero balance, can keep everyone else's withdrawals blocked by calling `withdraw(0)` after each processing event, paying only gas.
- A claimant whose own request has not been processed yet can be paid from funds processed for others.

No funds are lost: the reserve balance plus MoneyFi's pending amount still back the AEWT supply, and blocked users can recover by winning a later race. The impact grows if MoneyFi processes requests rarely or in large batches.

## Recommendation

- In `withdraw_fungible`, read the reserve's withdrawal state (`wallet_account::get_withdrawal_state`) and call `withdraw_requested_amount` only when the available amount is greater than zero. Pay from the reserve whenever its balance covers `amount`, and abort with a clear error otherwise.
- Add a per-user claim ledger (FIFO by request ID) so processed funds are paid to the requesters they belong to.
- Reject `amount == 0`.
- Optionally, add a permissionless `sync()` that pulls available funds into the reserve without paying anyone.

# [M-02] Locking exits and `request_and_withdraw` wrappers expect MoneyFi to settle in the same transaction and revert

## Severity

Medium

## Description

`locking::withdraw_early`, `withdraw_unlocked` and `emergency_unlock`, as well as `bridge::request_and_withdraw` and `glade_flexible::request_and_withdraw`, call the adapter's `request` and then `withdraw` in the same transaction:

```move
public entry fun request_and_withdraw(
    user: &signer,
    amount: u64,
    min_share_price: u128
) {
    moneyfi_adapter::request(user, amount, min_share_price);
    moneyfi_adapter::withdraw(user, amount)
}
```

MoneyFi withdrawals are asynchronous: a request is queued for an off-chain backend, and `withdraw_requested_amount` succeeds only once an amount has been made available. A request created in the current transaction can never be available within that transaction. The protocol's own GuaranteedYieldLocking module handles this correctly with a request step and a separate, later withdrawal step.

## Impact

- All three locking exits and both convenience wrappers fail in normal operation.
- If another user's processed funds happen to be available, the call succeeds by paying this user out of those funds, which is the queue jump described in M-01.
- No funds are lost because the revert is atomic. Users can still exit through `bridge::request` followed later by `bridge::withdraw`, but only because locking never takes custody of their AET (H-01). If H-01 were fixed with escrow but without a two-step exit, locked funds would become unreachable.

`glade_flexible::withdraw`, which performs only the second step, is not affected.

## Recommendation

- Give `locking` a two-step exit modelled on GuaranteedYieldLocking: `request_withdraw_locked(position_id)` records a pending exit, and `complete_withdraw_locked(position_id)` performs the withdrawal after MoneyFi has processed it, using controller custody (H-01).
- Remove `bridge::request_and_withdraw` and `glade_flexible::request_and_withdraw`, or restrict them to providers that settle synchronously.

# [M-03] `locking::emergency_unlock` burns only the AET needed for the payout, so the forfeited yield stays redeemable by the user

## Severity

Medium

## Description

An emergency unlock is meant to return at most the principal and forfeit any yield above it to the remaining holders. RFC-002 §8.1 says the forfeited yield "stays in pool (benefits remaining users)", §8.4 recommends burning the excess AET, and the locking test plan expects "Excess AET is burned" (TEST-CASES-LOCKING §5.3).

The implementation pays `min(principal, current_value)` (line 482) and requests only that amount from the bridge, which burns `floor(payout × 1e9 / share_price)` AET. The position is then deleted, but the rest of its AET is never burned or confiscated and remains in the user's wallet. The comment on line 497 is incorrect.

```move
// Remove position
vector::swap_remove(&mut user_positions.positions, index);

// Perform withdrawal for payout amount only
// The forfeited yield stays in the pool (AET is burned, value remains)
MoneyFiBridge::request(user, payout, share_price);
MoneyFiBridge::withdraw(user, payout);
```

## Impact

The emergency-exit penalty is not applied: the user keeps their accrued yield, and the remaining holders lose the windfall the design promises. The loss per exit is bounded by that position's accrued yield, and no principal is at risk. The same value can currently also be extracted through H-01, but this defect survives fixes to H-01 and M-02: with escrow, the residual AET would instead be orphaned in the controller, as in M-04.

## Recommendation

- Burn the excess AET (`aet_amount` minus the AET burned for the payout) as part of the emergency exit. Once custody is fixed (H-01), do this from the controller store through a `friend`-only adapter burn function.
- Alternatively, request the full `current_value` and route the excess to the pool or treasury as specified.
- Emit the AET actually burned (see L-01).

# [M-04] GuaranteedYieldLocking emergency unlock strands the forfeited-yield AET in the controller, untracked and unredeemable

## Severity

Medium

## Description

GuaranteedYieldLocking holds every position's AET in its controller. On an emergency unlock it requests only `base_payout = min(principal, current_value)` from MoneyFi, which burns the AET for that amount. The AET representing the yield above principal stays in the controller, but `total_aet_held` is reduced by the whole position's AET:

```move
// Update global stats
config.total_locked_principal -= principal;
config.total_aet_held -= position.aet_amount;
```

No function in the module ever requests or burns that untracked balance, because every later request is sized to a single position. This contradicts the module's own documentation: the comment on `withdraw_emergency_guaranteed` says the treasury receives "the remainder (cashback recovery + any forfeited yield)", and RFC-003 §4.3 says the "protocol keeps all yield above principal". In practice the treasury receives only the cashback clawback.

## Impact

- The forfeited yield of every emergency unlock with `current_value > principal`, which is expected protocol revenue, is stranded. The amount grows with yield and usage.
- Because the AET is never burned, it does not raise the share price for the other holders either.
- `get_protocol_stats` under-reports the AET the controller actually holds.

Users lose nothing. The value can only be recovered through a package upgrade that adds a sweep.

## Recommendation

- Request the full `current_value` in the first step and send `current_value - payout` to the treasury in the second step.
- Alternatively, track the surplus explicitly and add an admin `sweep` that redeems the untracked controller AET (the controller's AET balance minus `total_aet_held`) to the treasury.
- In both cases, decrement `total_aet_held` by the AET actually burned.

# [L-01] Emergency-unlock events report `yield_forfeited = 0` and overstate `aet_burned`

## Severity

Low

## Description

`withdraw_emergency_guaranteed` reconstructs the position's value at request time from `pending.withdrawal_amount`. That field already holds the capped `base_payout` (at most the principal), so the reconstruction always returns the capped value and `yield_forfeited` is always 0, including exactly when yield was forfeited.

```move
// Reconstruct event data from pending state
let principal = pending.position.principal;
let current_value = pending.withdrawal_amount + (
    if (pending.position.aet_amount > 0) {
        // If base_payout < current_value, yield was forfeited (stayed in pool)
        // We stored base_payout as withdrawal_amount, so compute original current_value
        let share_price_at_request = ((pending.withdrawal_amount as u128) * AET_SCALE) / (pending.position.aet_amount as u128);
        let original_current_value = ((pending.position.aet_amount as u128) * share_price_at_request / AET_SCALE) as u64;
        if (original_current_value > principal) { original_current_value - principal } else { 0 }
    } else { 0 }
);

let yield_forfeited =
    if (current_value > principal) {
        current_value - principal
    } else { 0 };
```

Both modules also report the whole position's AET as `aet_burned` (`GuaranteedYieldLocking.move:852`, `locking.move:507`), although only the AET equivalent to the payout is burned (see M-03 and M-04). The `yield_forfeited` value emitted by `locking` is computed correctly.

## Impact

Indexers, dashboards and treasury revenue analytics built on these events under-report forfeited yield and over-report AET burned. There is no on-chain effect on funds. For example, for a position with a 1,000 USDt principal unlocked at a share price of 1.1, `GuaranteedEmergencyUnlock` emits `yield_forfeited = 0` (true value about 100 USDt) and `aet_burned` of 1,000 AET (true value 909.090909 AET).

## Recommendation

- Store the request-time `current_value` (or the forfeited yield) and the AET actually burned in `PendingUnlock`, and emit those values.
- In `locking::emergency_unlock`, emit `floor(payout × 1e9 / share_price)` as `aet_burned`.

# [I-01] `CASHBACK_LOW_THRESHOLD` is 100 times the documented value

## Severity

Informational

## Description

`CASHBACK_LOW_THRESHOLD` is commented as 100 USDT but equals 10,000 USDt at 6 decimals, so the `CashbackVaultLow` warning fires at 100 times the documented level.

```move
// Warning threshold for cashback vault (configurable)
const CASHBACK_LOW_THRESHOLD: u64 = 100_00000000; // 100 USDT
```

## Recommendation

Set the constant to `100_000_000` (100 USDt at 6 decimals), or correct the comment if 10,000 USDt is the intended threshold.

# [I-02] Unused fields, error constants and helpers

## Severity

Informational

## Description

`bridge::State.signer_cap` and `LockConfig.signer_cap` are stored but never used. Several error constants are never referenced, including `ECLAIMS_DO_NOT_EXIST`, `ECLAIMS_ARE_LESS`, `ELP_AMOUNT_DOES_NOT_EXIST`, `ENOT_POSITION_OWNER`, `EUNSUPPORTED_PROVIDER` and `EOPERATION_NOT_PERMITTED`. The helpers `check_and_deposit_fa_to_address_opt` and `check_and_deposit_coin_to_address_opt` are never called.

## Recommendation

Remove the unused fields, constants and helpers, or use them where they were intended, for example `LockConfig.signer_cap` for controller custody (H-01).

# [I-03] The locking admin cannot be transferred

# [I-05] The bridge's `provider` parameter is accepted but ignored

# [I-06] The slippage check on locking exits can never fail

## Severity

Informational

## Description

Locking passes the share price it has just read as `min_share_price`, so the adapter's check `share_price >= min_share_price` always passes and users cannot set their own minimum.

```move
// Perform withdrawal through MoneyFiBridge
// First request, then withdraw
MoneyFiBridge::request(user, amount, share_price);
MoneyFiBridge::withdraw(user, amount);
```

## Recommendation

Let users pass their own `min_share_price` to the locking exit functions and forward it to the adapter.
