# [L-01] Anti-whale limit computed from MAX_SUPPLY, not current supply

## Severity

Low

## Description

`MAX_WALLET` is a constant equal to 3% of `MAX_SUPPLY`, or 1,160,700,000,000 IZK. The `_update` function enforces the limit after a transfer by checking whether `balanceOf(to)` exceeds `MAX_WALLET`. However, the public token documentation advertises the limit as “3% of current supply.”

Because the early-year circulating supply is small relative to the fixed maximum-supply-derived limit, the concentration protection is effectively inactive until approximately 2041. During the early emission years, a single wallet can therefore hold a share of the circulating supply many times larger than the advertised 3%.

## Impact

The advertised “maximum 3% per wallet” property is not enforced during the early years of the emission schedule. There is no direct loss of funds, but the implementation does not match the stated tokenomics and provides substantially weaker concentration protection than users may expect.

## Recommendation

Calculate the wallet limit dynamically as 3% of `totalSupply()`

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [I-01] Three tranche values deviate by one token from a strict Fibonacci series

## Severity

Informational

## Description

The tranche comments and whitepaper language describe a Fibonacci-style emission schedule. The implemented whole-token tranche values mostly follow `tranche[n] = tranche[n - 1] + tranche[n - 2]`, but three entries differ from a strict recurrence by exactly one whole token.

The 2030 tranche is one token above the strict sum, the 2037 tranche is one token below the strict sum, and the 2043 tranche is one token above the strict sum. The discrepancy is economically immaterial at the scale of the schedule and appears to be a rounding or documentation-consistency issue rather than a technical defect. The total schedule plus initial liquidity still reaches the hard cap as tested.

## Impact

The implementation does not exactly match a strict Fibonacci recurrence for every listed year. This may confuse reviewers or users comparing the implementation with the whitepaper, although the discrepancy is limited to one whole token in three tranches.

## Recommendation

Update the whitepaper or code comments to state that the tranche table is Fibonacci-derived with three one-token rounding adjustments rather than a strict recurrence for every listed year.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [I-02] Replacement minter must preserve the current tranche index

## Severity

Informational

## Description

If the Minter contract is replaced, the new instance must be initialized with a `startingYearIndex_` that exactly matches the previous minter’s `yearsMinted`. An incorrect or stale index can cause already-minted tranches to be repeated or future tranches to be skipped.

## Impact

Incorrect migration configuration can disrupt the intended emission schedule and may result in extra tokens being minted or scheduled tranches being skipped.

## Recommendation

During migration, verify that the replacement minter’s `startingYearIndex_` exactly matches the current emission progress before granting it `MINTER_ROLE`.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [I-03] startTime_ Can Be Initialized Too Far in the Past

## Severity

Informational

## Description

The Minter can be initialized with a `startTime_` that is significantly earlier than the current block timestamp. Without a lower-bound validation, an incorrectly configured deployment can begin with an emission start time that is already far in the past, affecting the intended timing of the schedule.

## Recommendation

For a first deployment, add a bounded validation such as:

```solidity
require(
    startTime_ <= block.timestamp &&
    startTime_ >= block.timestamp - GRACE_PERIOD
);
```

For a replacement minter, derive `startTime_` directly from the retired minter’s immutable `startTime` on-chain rather than accepting it as a new external input.

## Team Response

Fixed.

# [I-04] initialLiquidityMinted is module-local, allowing repeated initial liquidity to break the final tranche

## Severity

Informational

## Description

The `initialLiquidityMinted` flag is stored in the Minter contract rather than globally in the token. A replacement minter therefore starts with `initialLiquidityMinted = false`, allowing `mintInitialLiquidity()` to be executed again and mint an additional 38.5 billion IZK.

## Impact

A replacement minter can mint the 38.5 billion IZK initial-liquidity allocation a second time, consuming supply reserved for later emissions. When the emission schedule reaches the final tranches, minting can revert because the hard cap has already been consumed.

## Execution Cycle

Minter1 executes `mintInitialLiquidity()` legitimately → Minter1 is replaced by Minter2 with `initialLiquidityMinted = false` → Minter2 executes `mintInitialLiquidity()` again → the normal emission schedule continues → at index 22, `token.mint` reverts with `CapExceeded`.

## Recommendation

Store the “initial liquidity already minted” state globally in the token, pass the flag explicitly into the replacement minter’s constructor, or otherwise track the already-minted initial-liquidity allocation at the token level.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

# [I-05] Old and new minters can remain authorized at the same time

## Severity

Informational

## Description

The token does not maintain a single active minter. If a replacement minter is deployed with the correct `startingYearIndex_` but the previous minter is not deauthorized, both contracts can remain valid minters with the same emission progress. Since `mint()` is permissionless, each open emission window can be executed independently through both modules, causing the same tranche to be emitted twice.

## Impact

Overlapping minters can cause double payouts to the configured market and treasury emission addresses, resulting in over-emission. The hard cap is then reached prematurely, preventing the largest late-stage tranches from being minted. The issue does not allow a third party to redirect the emission to an arbitrary address; the duplicated payouts still go to the configured emission recipients.

## Execution Cycle

Minter A is operating → Minter B is added with the correct index → Minter A remains authorized → `mint()` is called on both A and B during each open window → each tranche is emitted twice → in a later year, `token.mint` reverts with `CapExceeded`.

## Recommendation

Enforce a single active minter at the token level. For example, store an `activeMinter` address in the token and allow minting only from that address, with replacement performed atomically. Alternatively, track tranche execution directly in the token so the same tranche cannot be minted by more than one module.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.
