# [H-01] Unbounded programPenaltyReports Loop Causes Gas-Exhaustion DoS on Deposit, Debt Payment, and Refund

## Severity

High

## Location

```solidity
EscrowVault.sol:L368,EscrowVault.sol:L442-L497
```

## Description

Every call to `EscrowVault.accrueCompanyPenalty()` at L368 appends a new `bytes32` entry to `programPenaltyReports[programId]`:

```solidity
programPenaltyReports[programId].push(reportId);
```

There is no cap on this array. Entries are never removed. The array grows monotonically with every second-opinion resolve that triggers a company penalty, across all reports associated with a program over its entire lifetime.

`_applyPenaltyPayment()` at L452 iterates the entire array on every invocation:

```solidity
for (uint256 i = 0; i < reportCount ; i++) {
    bytes32 rId = reportIds[i];
    uint256 reportDebt = repor tPenaltyDebt[rId];
    if (reportDebt == 0) continue ;
    // ... transfer logic ...
}
```

The `continue` on fully-paid entries (L455) saves the transfer cost, but the SLOAD for `reportPenaltyDebt[rId]` is still executed for every entry. Paid-off entries therefore remain in the iteration permanently, keeping the loop cost elevated even after all debt is cleared.

`_applyPenaltyPayment()` is called on every `deposit()` (L157), `payPenaltyDebt()` (L222), and `refund()` (L320) when `companyPenaltyDebt[programId] > 0`. This means any program that has accumulated enough penalty accrual events will have these three entry points permanently bricked - all transactions will run out of gas.

## Impact

At approximately 9,504-9,591 gas per array entry (measured at n=200 and n=250), the 30M Ethereum block gas limit is reached at approximately 3,127 cumulative penalty entries. Once this threshold is crossed, `deposit()`, `payPenaltyDebt()`, and `refund()` for the affected program all revert with out-ofgas. The company cannot top up its bounty pool, cannot clear its debt, and cannot recover its escrowed funds. All researchers with open approved reports cannot be paid. There is no admin escape hatch targeting the loop itself. This finding also creates a vector for a compound attack when combined with `emergencyBountyPayout` - see H-06.

## Recommendation

Replace the always-on iteration with a paginated or pruning approach. The simplest fix is to remove paid-off entries by swapping them with the last element and popping the array when `reportPenaltyDebt[rId]` is zeroed out during payment processing:

```solidity
// After zeroing reportPenaltyDebt[rId] inside the loop:
// Swap-and-pop to prune the array
reportIds[i] = reportIds[reportCount - 1];
reportIds.pop();
reportCount--;
i--; // re-check the swapped entry
```

Alternatively, introduce a separate `paidReportIds` mapping and a maximum-entries-per-call parameter to bound gas regardless of array length. The swap-and-pop approach is preferred as it eliminates the root accumulation issue without requiring callers to manage pagination.

# [M-01] Rejected reports are excluded from blocking report accounting before their dispute window has expired

## Severity

Medium

## Description and Impact

In `ReportManager.markApprovedPrimary()`, a primary decision with `severity == 0` immediately transitions the report from `SUBMITTED` to `REJECTED`:

```solidity
if (severity == 0) {
    _transitionStatus(report , Status.REJECTED);
}
```

However, `REJECTED` is not treated as a blocking state in `ReportManager._isBlockingStatus()`. As a result, moving from `SUBMITTED` to `REJECTED` decrements `blockingReportCount` immediately, even though the rejection is not economically or procedurally final until the report’s `timelockEnd` has passed.

The root cause is a mismatch between lifecycle rights and refund-blocking accounting. The protocol still gives the researcher a live post-rejection remedy during the timelock window: `PayoutController.escalateReport()` explicitly allows escalation from `ReportManager.Status.REJECTED` so long as `block.timestamp < report.timelockEnd`. In other words, the report remains contestable, but the blocking-report accounting treats it as fully resolved.

This inconsistency allows the registry to believe there are no open blocking reports when, in reality, a rejected report can still be escalated. Since `BountyProgramRegistry.initiateRefund()` only checks `hasBlockingReports(programId)`, a company may be able to initiate the refund flow while a researcher’s escalation window is still open. Once that happens, the program can transition toward `PAUSED` and ultimately `CLOSED` despite the fact that the report was not yet final from the researcher’s perspective.

The impact is that researchers can lose their practical ability to challenge a primary rejection, because the protocol may permit shutdown and refund actions during the active dispute window. This creates a race between the company’s refund initiation and the researcher’s escalation right. Operationally, it weakens the dispute-resolution guarantees of the system and can cause reports to be treated as finalized too early, resulting in premature fund withdrawal, broken report lifecycle assumptions, and unfair loss of recourse for researchers.

## Recommendation

The best mitigation is to keep rejected reports in the blocking set until their dispute window has actually expired, or until they become truly final through some explicit terminal transition.

- Treat `REJECTED` as a blocking status in `_isBlockingStatus()` for the duration of the escalation window.

# [M-02] Program can be activated while penalty debt remains unpaid due to proportional rounding during penalty repayment

## Severity

Medium

## Root Cause

_applyPenaltyPayment() distributes the repayment proportionally across all penalized reports using integer division:

uint256 reportPayment = (penaltyPaid * reportDebt) / totalDebt;

Because integer division rounds down, some reports may receive reportPayment == 0 and are skipped entirely. Consequently, only actualPaid is applied toward reducing companyPenaltyDebt, while the remaining deposited funds are treated as a normal program deposit.

## Description

When a program owner deposits funds, the protocol first attempts to repay any outstanding penalty debt by calling _applyPenaltyPayment(). However, proportional allocation using integer division can round some report allocations down to zero, causing those reports to receive no repayment.

Only the successfully allocated amount (actualPaid) is deducted from the deposit, while the remaining funds continue through the normal deposit flow, increasing the program’s bounty balance. At the end of deposit(), the protocol activates the program even though some penalty reports may still have outstanding debt because they were skipped during the proportional distribution.

## Impact

A program may transition to the ACTIVE state before all penalty obligations have been settled.

As a result:

treasuryPay, primaryPay, and secondaryPay are never executed for those reports, part of the deposit intended to repay penalties is instead used to fund the program’s bounty pool, the protocol reaches an inconsistent state where the program is active despite outstanding penalty debt.

# [M-03] Emergency Close Is Unreachable For Permanently Blocked Researcher Payouts

## Severity

Medium

## Description

`emergencyCloseReport()` is intended to close reports whose normal bounty payout cannot be completed, such as when the researcher is blacklisted by USDC. That recovery path is unreachable because it only accepts reports in `READY_TO_PAY`, but no execution path leaves a report in that state across transactions.

In `finalizeAndPay()`, reports coming from `APPROVED_PRIMARY`, `ESCALATED_RESOLVED`, or `SECOND_OPINION_RESOLVED` are first transitioned to `READY_TO_PAY` through `reports.markReadyToPay(reportId)`. The same transaction then immediately continues to `reports.markPaid(reportId)` and

```solidity
escrow.payoutBounty(programId, researcher, payoutAmount).
```

If the bounty transfer fails because the payout token blocks transfers to the researcher, `EscrowVault.payoutBounty()` reverts with `TRANSFER_FAILED`. That revert rolls back the entire `finalizeAndPay()` call, including the earlier `markReadyToPay()`. As a result, the report never persists in `READY_TO_PAY`, so the admin-only `emergencyCloseReport()` function can never be used for the exact stuck-payout scenario it was added to handle.

## Impact

The documented emergency recovery flow for blacklisted researchers is non-functional. When a normal payout is permanently blocked, the report remains stuck in a blocking adjudicated status such as `APPROVED_PRIMARY`, `ESCALATED_RESOLVED`, or `SECOND_OPINION_RESOLVED`, and the admin cannot close it through `emergencyCloseReport()`.

## Root Cause

`src/PayoutController.sol` assumes `READY_TO_PAY` can act as a durable intermediate state for emergency handling, but `finalizeAndPay()` both enters and exits that state in the same transaction.

## Vulnerability Path

**1.** A report reaches `APPROVED_PRIMARY`, `ESCALATED_RESOLVED`, or `SECOND_OPINION_RESOLVED` and becomes eligible for final payout.

**2.** The assigned judge calls `finalizeAndPay()`.

**3.** `finalizeAndPay()` calls `reports.markReadyToPay(reportId)` and then proceeds toward `reports.markPaid(reportId)` and `escrow.payoutBounty(programId,`

```solidity
researcher, payoutAmount).
```

**4.** The payout token rejects the transfer to the researcher, such as because the researcher address is USDC-blacklisted.

**5.** `EscrowVault.payoutBounty()` reverts, which reverts the full `finalizeAndPay()` transaction and undoes the earlier `READY_TO_PAY` transition.

**6.** The report remains in its pre-existing adjudicated status instead of persisting in `READY_TO_PAY`.

**7.** The admin calls `emergencyCloseReport(reportId)`, but it reverts with `NOT_READY_TO_PAY`, so the intended emergency close path is unavailable.

# [L-01] Missing Payout Schedule Requirement in approvePrimary

## Severity

Low

## Problem

The protocol allows the creation of "empty" programs (no payout schedule), but the approval logic expects one. This creates a "dead-end" workflow.

## Logic Breakdown

Creation: _storePayoutSchedule allows severityCount == 0, resulting in hasPayoutSchedule = false. Validation: approvePrimary contains: require(registry.hasPayoutSchedule(programId), "SCHEDULE_REQUIRED");.

## Impact

A company can successfully launch a program and researchers can submit work. However, when a judge attempts to approve a report, the transaction will always revert. The program is essentially a trap where work is performed but cannot be processed through the standard primary approval path.

## Recommendation

Enforce that a payout schedule with at least one severity must be provided during the program initialization phase in the registry.

# [L-02] Second Opinion Flow Restricts Secondary Judge to Confirm/Downgrade/Invalidate Only, Preventing Honest Severity Upgrades, Compounded by Mutual Exclusivity With Escalation

## Severity

Low

## Description

The `PayoutController::approveSecondOpinion()` function constrains the secondary judge to three outcomes: confirm the primary severity (`outcome == 0`), downgrade it (`outcome == 1`), or invalidate the finding entirely (`outcome == 2`). There is no outcome that allows the secondary judge to upgrade the severity above what the primary judge assigned.

```solidity
// outcome 0 -- CONFIRM: severity must exactly match primary
if (outcome == 0) {
    require(severity == report.primarySeverity, "SEVERITY_MISMATCH");
}
// outcome 1 -- DOWNGRADE: severity must be strictly less than primary
else if (outcome == 1) {
    require(severity > 0, "INVALID_SEVERITY");
    // ...
    require(severity < report.primarySeverity, "SEVERITY_NOT_DOWNGRADE");
}
// outcome 2 -- INVALIDATE : severity must be 0
else if (outcome == 2) {
    require(severity == 0, "INVALIDATE_SEVERITY");
}
```

If the secondary judge genuinely believes the finding is a higher severity than the primary judge assessed, their only option is to confirm at the primary severity - they cannot express their honest judgment. This is particularly damaging when combined with the fact that `escalation` and `second opinion` are mutually exclusive: `PayoutController::requestSecondOpinion()` requires `APPROVED_PRIMARY` status, and `PayoutController::escalateReport()` transitions the report to `ESCALATED`. Whichever party acts first during the timelock window locks out the other. If the company front-runs the researcher’s escalation by requesting a second opinion, the researcher permanently loses their ability to dispute upward, and the second judge is simultaneously prevented from correcting the severity upward.

Note: This is also not a particulary fair system, as when a researcher escelates a report the second judge is free to confirm, upgrade or downgrade the severity. But as mentioned in the case of a second opinion request by a team, the severity can only be confirmed or reduced by the second judge.

## Attack Path

**1.** A researcher submits a report. The primary judge approves it at severity 2 (Medium). The report enters `APPROVED_PRIMARY` with a timelock window.

**2.** The researcher believes the finding is Critical (severity 4) and intends to escalate.

**3.** The company calls `requestSecondOpinion()` first - the report status moves to `SECOND_OPINION_REQUESTED`.

**4.** The researcher can no longer call `escalateReport()` because the report is no longer in `APPROVED_PRIMARY` or `REJECTED` status.

**5.** The admin assigns a secondary judge. The secondary judge reviews the report and believes the finding is Critical.

**6.** The secondary judge cannot set severity 4. Their only options are: confirm Medium (outcome 0), downgrade to Low (outcome 1), or invalidate (outcome 2).

**7.** The secondary judge is forced to confirm at Medium - the researcher receives a Medium payout for a Critical finding.

## Root Cause

`PayoutController::approveSecondOpinion()` only defines three outcome paths (confirm, downgrade, invalidate) with no upgrade path. The `PayoutController::requestSecondOpinion()` function requires `Status.APPROVED_PRIMARY`, while `PayoutController::escalateReport()` also requires `APPROVED_PRIMARY` or `REJECTED` - making them mutually exclusive once either is called. The `ReportManager::markSecondOpinionRequested()` does accept `ESCALATED` status, suggesting the original design may have intended to allow both flows, but `PayoutController::requestSecondOpinion()` does not use that path.

## Impact

- The secondary judge cannot give an honest assessment when they believe severity should be higher, undermining the integrity of the dispute resolution system.
- A company can strategically front-run a researcher’s escalation by requesting a second opinion first, knowing the outcome can only stay the same or go lower.
- Researchers can be permanently underpaid for legitimate high-severity findings with no remaining recourse - they cannot escalate, and the second judge cannot upgrade on their behalf.

## Recommendation

Add an `UPGRADE` outcome (`outcome == 3`) to `approveSecondOpinion()` that allows the secondary judge to set a severity higher than the primary:

```solidity
 function approveSecondOpin ion(
     uint256 programId,
     address researcher,
     bytes32 reportHash,
     uint8 severity,
     uint8 outcome
 ) external nonReentrant {
     require(judges.isJudge (msg.sender), "NOT_JUDGE");
     require(researcher != address(0), "RESEARCHER_ZERO");
     require(reportHash != bytes32(0), "HASH_ZERO");
-    require(outcome == 0 || outcome == 1 || outcome == 2, "INVALID_OUTCOME ");
+    require(outcome <= 3, "INVALID_OUTCOME");

     // ... existing config/status checks ...

     if (outcome == 0) {
         require(severity == report.primarySeverity, "SEVERITY_MISMATCH ");
         payoutAmount = report.payoutAmount;
         companyPenaltyBps = config.companyPenaltyBps;
     } else if (outcome == 1) {
         // ... existing downgrade logic ...
     } else if (outcome == 2) {
         require(severity == 0, "INVALIDATE_SEVERITY");
         judgePenaltyBps = config.judgePenaltyInvalidBps;
         payoutAmount = 0;
+    } else if (outcome == 3) {
+        require(severity > report.primarySeverity, "SEVERITY_NOT_UPGRADE ");
+        require(severity < 5, "INVALID_SEVERITY");
+        payoutAmount = registry.payoutBySeverity(programId, severity);
+        require(payoutAmo unt > 0, "SEVERITY_NOT_CONFIGURED");
+        judgePenaltyBps = config.judgePenaltyDowngradeBps;
     }
```

Additionally, consider allowing `escalateReport()` to work on reports in `SECOND_OPINION_REQUESTED` status, so that both parties can express their disagreement with the primary judgement independently.

# [L-03] withdraw() Always Emits Zero as Withdrawn Amount

## Severity

Low

## Description

The `withdraw` function sends the entire contract balance to the admin and then emits Withdrawn with `address(this)`.balance as the amount. Because the ETH transfer executes before the event emission, `address(this).balance` is already zero at the point the event is emitted. Every Withdrawn event will log an amount of zero regardless of how much ETH was actually withdrawn.

## Root Cause

The balance is read after the transfer rather than before it:

```solidity
function withdraw() exte rnal onlyAdmin {
    (bool ok,) = payable (msg.sender).call{value: address(this).balance }("");
    require(ok, "ETH_T RANSFER_FAILED");
    emit Withdrawn(msg. sender, address(this).balance); // balance is now 0
}
```

## Impact

Off-chain systems, monitoring dashboards, and audit trails that rely on events to track fund flows will always see a withdrawn amount of zero. This makes the event log unreliable for accounting purposes.

## Recommendation

Capture the balance before the transfer and use the cached value in the event:

```solidity
function withdraw() exte rnal onlyAdmin {
    uint256 amount = address(this).balance;
    (bool ok,) = payable (msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
    require(ok, "ETH_T RANSFER_FAILED");
    emit Withdrawn(msg. sender, amount);
}
```

# [I-01] Companies Cannot Reliably Close Active Programs Because Refund Initiation Requires Zero Blocking Reports

## Severity

Informational

## Description

`initiateRefund()` can only succeed when the target program has zero blocking reports, but the program is not paused until after that check passes. While the program remains `ACTIVE`, new reports can still be submitted, and each new `SUBMITTED` report immediately becomes blocking.

As a result, a company cannot use the refund flow to first stop report intake and then resolve any remaining reports. Instead, the company must wait for the blocking report count to naturally reach zero while the program is still live. For a bounty program with ongoing report activity, that state may never occur in practice.

This makes closure dependent on the program already being effectively idle. A company that wants to shut down an active bounty has no protocol-controlled way to stop new reports from arriving before satisfying the zero-blocking-report condition, so the refund flow can be denied indefinitely by ordinary report inflow.

# [I-02] Blacklisted Judge Can Brick Company Penalty Settlement And Block Refunds

## Severity

Informational

## Description

When a company requests second opinion and the second judge confirms the original approval (`outcome == 0`), the protocol charges the company a penalty. `approveSecondOpinion()` sets `companyPenaltyBps` for that case and calls `escrow.accrueCompanyPenalty(...)`, which records the penalty debt together with the primary and secondary judge addresses that must receive the judges’ shares of the payment.

Later, every path that clears company penalty debt routes through `EscrowVault._applyPenaltyPayment()`: `payPenaltyDebt()`, `refund()`, and even `deposit()` when an outstanding penalty exists. `_applyPenaltyPayment()` attempts to transfer the treasury share and both judge shares with strict `require(token.transfer(...))` checks.

If either stored judge address is blacklisted by the payout token (USDC), the corresponding transfer reverts and the entire debt-clearing transaction reverts. Because the penalty debt remains outstanding and every settlement path reuses the same helper, the company cannot clear the debt through manual payment and `executeRefund()` cannot complete either.

## Impact

A single blacklisted judge address inside a confirmed second-opinion penalty can permanently lock the program’s penalty debt. The company cannot settle the debt through `payPenaltyDebt()`, and once the program is paused and ready for closure, `executeRefund()` also reverts while trying to distribute that judge’s penalty share.

## Root Cause

`src/PayoutController.sol` accrues company penalty debt on confirmed second-opinion outcomes:

```solidity
if (companyPenaltyBps > 0 && payoutAmount > 0) {
    uint256 penaltyAmount = (payoutAmount * companyPenaltyBps) / 10_000;
    if (penaltyAmount > 0) {
        escrow.accrueCompanyPenalty(programId , reportId, penaltyAmount, report.
            primaryJudge, report.secondaryJudge);
    }
}
```

`src/EscrowVault.sol` then stores the judges as mandatory payout recipients and later enforces direct token transfers to them inside `_applyPenaltyPayment()`:

```solidity
require(token.transfer(pj, primaryPay), "PENALTY_PRIMARY_TRANSFER_FAILED");
require(token.transfer(sj, secondaryPay), "PENALTY_SECONDARY_TRANSFER_FAILED");
```

Because `payPenaltyDebt()`, `refund()`, and `deposit()` all call `_applyPenaltyPayment()`, any failed transfer to one blacklisted judge reverts the full penalty-settlement operation and leaves `companyPenaltyDebt` uncleared.

## Vulnerability Path

**1.** A company requests second opinion for an approved report.

**2.** The assigned second judge returns `outcome == 0` and confirms the primary decision.

**3.** `approveSecondOpinion()` computes the company penalty and

```solidity
calls            accrueCompanyPenalty(programId, reportId, penaltyAmount,
report.primaryJudge, report.secondaryJudge).
```

**4.** The penalty debt is stored along with the two judge addresses that must receive the judges’ shares when the debt is later settled.

**5.** One of those judge addresses is blacklisted by the payout token, such as USDC.

**6.** The company later tries to clear the debt through `payPenaltyDebt()` or reaches `executeRefund()`, which calls `EscrowVault.refund()`.

**7.** `_applyPenaltyPayment()` attempts `token.transfer(...)` to the blacklisted judge, reverts, and rolls back the full transaction.

**8.** The company penalty debt remains outstanding, and the company cannot complete the refund flow for that program.

# [I-03] Untracked Pending Obligations Allow bountyBalance Overcommitment Across Concurrent Reports

## Severity

Informational

## Summary

Solvency checks in approvePrimary and finalizeEscalation validate bountyBalance against each report’s payout in isolation, without accounting for funds already committed to other approved but unpaid reports. This allows the same funds to be implicitly promised to multiple reports simultaneously, with the shortfall only surfacing when finalizeAndPay is called.

## Root Cause

The contract lacks a pendingObligations tracker per programId. Every solvency check measures raw bountyBalance instead of uncommitted balance, meaning concurrent approved reports can collectively exceed available funds.

## Impact

Any report whose committed funds are later consumed by another finalization becomes permanently unpayable - finalizeAndPay reverts indefinitely, blockingReportCount is never decremented, and the program refund mechanism is blocked.

## Recommendation

Introduce a per-program pendingObligations[programId] that will track how much money is already commited for a program.
