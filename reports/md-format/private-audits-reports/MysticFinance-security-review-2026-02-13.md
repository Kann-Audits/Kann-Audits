# [Low-01] Incorrect Constructor Arguments Used in ZeroExOptimized Verification

## Severity

Low

## Description

In the deployment script, the `ZeroExOptimized` contract is deployed using the bootstrapper address obtained from `fullMigration.getBootstrapper()`.

```javascript
 const zeroExOptimized = await deployContract(ZeroExOptimizedFactory, [await fullMigration.getBootstrapper()]);
    console.log("ZeroExOptimized deployed to:", zeroExOptimized.address);
```

However, during the verification step, the script incorrectly uses the `FullMigration` contract address as the constructor argument.

```javascript
await verifyContract(hre, deploymentResults.contracts.ZeroExOptimized, [deploymentResults.contracts.FullMigration]);
```

This mismatch causes verification failures because the constructor arguments provided to the verification function do not match those used during deployment.

## Root cause:

The verification logic does not account for the actual constructor parameter used when deploying `ZeroExOptimized`.
Instead of using the bootstrapper address returned by `fullMigration.getBootstrapper()`, it mistakenly uses `fullMigration.address`, resulting in incorrect verification data.

## Recommendation:

Pass bootstrapper as the constructor argument during verification.

```javascript
const bootstrapper = await fullMigration.getBootstrapper();
deploymentResults.bootstrapper = bootstrapper;
await verifyContract(hre, deploymentResults.contracts.ZeroExOptimized, [deploymentResults.bootstrapper])
```
