# [L-01] A write-off values the claims' part of a failed sink at its last booked price, so claimants share the sink's loss instead of being paid first

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

Liquidation claims come first on the vault's USDG (L267). When a sink is written off with claims unpaid, #22 and #25 set aside part of the sink's shares for those claims. They size that part at `sinkRate`, the sink's price recorded at the last `_accrue` before the detach. A sink is written off because it failed, and nothing updates its price while it is detached. If it lost value, that price is too high, so the claimants get too few shares and share the loss pro rata with the holders. The difference goes to the holders, including anyone who deposited after the liquidation.

Our recommendation for #22 suggested this price. It only keeps claims first when the sink has kept its value.

## Finding Description

```solidity
uint256 r = sinkRate[w.token];                                                       // L794: price before the detach
uint256 cs = Math.min(w.shares, Math.mulDiv(need, RATE_UNIT, r, Math.Rounding.Ceil)); // shares for `need` at that price
uint256 v = Math.min(need, Math.mulDiv(cs, r, RATE_UNIT));
...
_liqPoolUnits = units - covered;                                                     // claims cut by the full booked value
```

The claims are cut by the booked value `v`, but the `cs` shares they receive are worth only `v × (real price / booked price)`. On the redeem path, the same loss falls on the holders first and the claims are paid in full.

## Attack Path

1. Alice holds 10 shares, and a liquidation leaves her a 450 USDG claim.
2. Bob deposits 10 stock afterwards. The sink's price is booked at that point.
3. The sink loses half its value, and its views fail. The owner calls `detachSink`.
4. The owner calls `acceptDetachLoss`. The claims' part is sized at the old price, so it is worth half of what alice is owed.
5. Bob, as a holder, keeps the shares that would have paid the rest of her claim.

## Impact

Measured in the PoC (USDG; the written-off sink is worth half its booked price):

|  | Alice (claim 450) | Bob (deposited after) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Redeem the sink (claims first) | +277.02 | −277.02 |
| Write it off | +138.51 | −138.51 |

The claimant loses 138.51 of her claim to a holder who joined after the liquidation. The amount moved is the sink's loss on the claims' part, multiplied by the other holders' share of the vault.

## Likelihood

Low. It needs a write-off with liquidation claims unpaid, and a sink that lost value, which is the usual reason for a write-off. For the loss to move between people, someone must also hold shares but not claims.

## Recommendation

Don't price the failed sink at all. Keep the claims as USDG claims, and pay them from what the sink actually pays out:

- **At the booking,** don't carve a claims part out of the sink. The claim cut, `sinkRate`, `_simCredit`, `_writeOffClaimUnits` and the claims half of `_inKind` are then no longer needed.
- **Fund the claims from the sink.** Add a permissionless `fundClaimsFromWriteOff(i)` that redeems from the written-off sink only what the unpaid claims still need beyond the vault's other USDG. If the sink is worth less than that, it takes everything the sink pays. It never takes more, so nothing it brings back can become interest.
- **Release the holders afterwards.** Holders take their part in kind once the claims are backed, or once the sink's shares are used up. The first release locks the write-off, so it can't be drawn for claims again.

```solidity
struct WriteOff { address token; uint256 units; uint256 unitsLeft; bool released; uint256 booking; }
mapping(uint256 => uint256) private _bookingNeedLeft; // set at booking: the claims these write-offs back, valued then

function fundClaimsFromWriteOff(uint256 i) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 got) {
    if (detachPending() || i >= _writeOffsBooked) revert Paused();
    WriteOff storage w = writeOffs[i];

    _accrue();
    uint256 need = _claimsNeed(); // _liqPoolUnits - _grossUsdg(), or 0
    uint256 budget = _bookingNeedLeft[w.booking];
    if (need == 0) { _bookingNeedLeft[w.booking] = 0; return 0; } // claims backed: later shortfalls never draw here

        }
    }
    got = usdg.balanceOf(address(this)) - bal0;
    _bookingNeedLeft[w.booking] = got >= budget ? 0 : budget - got;
}

function claimWrittenOff(uint256 i) external nonReentrant returns (uint256 out) {
    if (i >= _writeOffsBooked) revert Paused();
    WriteOff storage w = writeOffs[i];
    uint256 bal = IERC20(w.token).balanceOf(address(this));
    if (!w.released) {
        _accrue();
        if (bal > 0 && _bookingNeedLeft[w.booking] > 0 && _claimsNeed() > 0) revert ClaimsFirst(); // claims first
        w.released = true;
    }
    ... // holders' part: Math.mulDiv(bal, u, w.unitsLeft); w.unitsLeft -= u (see L-02)
}
```

The budget matters. Without it, a write-off that no holder has claimed yet would back *any* later shortfall. If the vault reopened and a new sink then lost value, the old holders' shares would pay for it. In our test that took all 44.60 USDG of their shares, while the new holder paid nothing. With the budget, the old holders contribute at most what the claims at their write-off needed, which is exactly what the redeem path would take from them.

The keeper can also call `fundClaimsFromWriteOff` best-effort right after `acceptDetachLoss`.

With this change, a write-off gives everyone what redeeming the sink would, even when the sink lost value, and it uses no price and no payment order. The trade-off: until the failed sink pays out, the holders' part and new deposits wait. That follows the vault's existing rule that deposits stay closed while claims are underwater. If the sink never pays, the claims stay owed, as they would on the redeem path.

Tested on a prototype:

- Write-off equals redeem for every holder over 3,001 fuzz runs, with the sink losing 0–90% of its value, plus claims, a later depositor, a liquidation during the detach and partial recovery.
- The PoCs for #21, #23 and #24 stay fixed.
- The #22, #25 and #26 scenarios give exactly the redeem-path result in our differential tests, including two write-offs with a reopen in between.
- A shortfall after a reopen no longer draws on the earlier write-off (0 drawn, the old holders' shares untouched).
- The team's suite passes once `fundClaimsFromWriteOff` is called where claims are expected to be backed, including K25's half-value case. One assertion that expects claims to be paid in shares has to change, because they are now paid in USDG.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**Valid · Low · Fixed** (as recommended)

Regression: `test_K28_WriteOffUsesNoPriceClaimsFirst` follows your scenario (sink at half value): alice and bob end where the redeem path leaves them. `test_K28_LaterShortfallNeverDrawsOnOldWriteOff` covers the budget. The #22, #25 and #26 tests now call `fundClaimsFromWriteOff`, and the claims are paid in USDG.

Fix: PR #34.

# [L-02] Rounded-down claim cuts at one write-off make a later write-off owe more shares than the vault holds, so the last claimer's part is stuck

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

When a write-off pays part of the liquidation claims in kind, `_setAsideForClaims` lowers the claim pool by the exact value covered. `_simCredit` lowers each claimant's claim by a rounded-down share of it. Afterwards, the claimants' claims add up to a few units more than the pool. At the next write-off, the claimants' part is split by `claim / poolUnits`, so the vault owes slightly more shares of that sink than it holds. The last claimer's `claimWrittenOff` then reverts, and because the holder and claimant parts are paid in one transfer, their whole in-kind part is stuck.

## Finding Description

```solidity
uint256 cutUnits = Math.mulDiv(atBook, w.claimValue, w.poolUnits);   // _simCredit L863: rounded down, per claimant
...
_liqPoolUnits = units - covered;                                     // _setAsideForClaims L815: exact total
...
out += Math.mulDiv(w.claimShares, cu, w.poolUnits);                  // _inKind L775 at the next write-off:
                                                                     // the claims cu add up to more than poolUnits
```

## Attack Path

No attacker is needed.

1. Alice and bob hold liquidation claims. The sink fails; a tenth comes back and the rest is written off, which pays part of the claims in kind.
2. Alice claims her part, so her claim is cut (rounded down). Bob's cut is applied later, the same way.
3. The vault moves to a new sink, which fails and is written off too.
4. Bob claims his part of the second write-off. Alice's `claimWrittenOff(1)` reverts with `ERC20InsufficientBalance`.

## Impact

In the PoC the vault owes 120.919416e18 shares of the second sink and holds 120.919415e18 (1 wei of USDG short). Alice's part, 90 USDG worth of shares, can't be claimed until someone sends the vault the missing shares. A fuzz run of the same two-write-off flow hit this on its 4th input.

## Likelihood

Low. It needs two write-offs that both pay claims in kind, with at least two claimants whose cuts don't divide evenly.

## Recommendation

Round each claimant's cut up, so the claims can never add up to more than the pool:

```solidity
uint256 cutUnits = Math.mulDiv(atBook, w.claimValue, w.poolUnits, Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```

Tested:

- The PoC's vault now holds at least what it owes (owed 120.919414e18 vs 120.919415e18 held).
- The two-write-off fuzz passes 2,000 runs (it failed on run 4 before).
- Our write-off property tests still pass.

Rounding up costs each claimant less than one claim unit (1 wei of USDG). An exact running-total split is not possible here, because claimants are credited lazily, one at a time and in any order.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**Valid · Low · Fixed** (by the #28 change)

The claims' in-kind part and the per-claimant claim cuts no longer exist, so there is nothing to round. Each holder's part is a pro-rata share of what is left of the sink, so the last claimer always gets the remainder.

Regression: `test_K30_SecondWriteOffNeverOwesMoreThanHeld` runs your two-write-off flow. Every `claimWrittenOff` goes through, and both sinks end fully handed out.

Fix: PR #34.

# [L-03] The best-effort withdrawals fall back to `maxWithdraw`/`maxRedeem`, which Morpho VaultV2 always reports as 0, so deleverage and partial recovery take nothing when the sink is short

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`, `RaetoVault.sol`

## Summary

The fixes made several withdrawals best-effort: `_withdrawUpTo` (behind `deleverage` and `unwind`), the partial recovery in `redeemRetired`, and `executeSink`'s partial path. When the full amount can't be paid, each falls back to `maxWithdraw` or `maxRedeem`. The sink every vault uses is a Morpho VaultV2 (`0xBeEf…09dd`), whose `maxWithdraw` and `maxRedeem` always return 0, which ERC-4626 allows. On the live sink, `maxWithdraw(RaetoVault)` is 0 while RaetoVault holds 928 USDG of its shares. So when the sink can pay part of what is needed but not all, the vault takes nothing.

## Finding Description

```solidity
// _withdrawUpTo, L1139 (redeemRetired L652 / executeSink L703 / RaetoVault.redeemRetired L406 use maxRedeem)
try s.maxWithdraw(address(this)) returns (uint256 m) {   // Morpho VaultV2: always 0
    if (m > need) m = need;
    if (m > 0) try s.withdraw(m, address(this), address(this)) {} catch {}
} catch {}
```

VaultV2's `withdraw` pays from its idle USDG (16.1M on the live sink) and its liquidity adapter. It never checks `max*`, so a smaller withdrawal would have gone through.

## Attack Path

No attacker is needed. This takes a sink liquidity shortfall together with a price move.

1. The sink's payable liquidity drops below what the vault needs.
2. The stock falls, and anyone calls `deleverage()`. The full withdrawal reverts, the fallback reads 0, and nothing is repaid.
3. If the fall continues past the liquidation threshold, Morpho liquidates the vault's collateral, with the liquidation bonus.

## Impact

Measured in the PoC, with the sink able to pay 100 of the vault's 900:

|  | Sink that reports `max*` | VaultV2 behaviour (`max*` = 0) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debt after `deleverage` | 900 → 800 | 900 → **900** |
| Recovered in part by `redeemRetired` | 100 | **0** (exits stay paused) |

## Likelihood

Low. It needs the sink to be able to pay some, but not all, of what the vault needs. The vault's needs are small against VaultV2's 16.1M idle, so that band is narrow.

## Recommendation

Don't size the fallback from `max*` alone. When it reports 0, fall back to the USDG the sink holds idle, which VaultV2 pays out first, capped at the vault's own position:

```solidity
function _payableNow(IERC4626 s) internal view returns (uint256 m) {
    try s.maxWithdraw(address(this)) returns (uint256 x) { m = x; } catch {}
    if (m == 0) m = usdg.balanceOf(address(s)); // VaultV2 reports 0; its idle USDG is what it pays first
    try s.convertToAssets(s.balanceOf(address(this))) returns (uint256 mine) { if (m > mine) m = mine; } catch {}
}

// _withdrawUpTo:                    uint256 m = _payableNow(s); if (m > need) m = need; try s.withdraw(m, ...)
// redeemRetired / executeSink:      uint256 m = _payableNow(old); try old.withdraw(m, ...)
```

The fallback only runs after the full withdrawal has failed. At that point the vault's position is worth more than the sink can pay, so `m` is always within the vault's own shares.

For a sink other than VaultV2, the idle balance is only a hint. The withdrawal is still attempted in a `try`, and every caller measures what actually arrived. Add a fork test against the live VaultV2 as well as a mock whose `max*` returns 0.

Tested: with VaultV2's behaviour, `deleverage` repays 100 (debt 900 → 800) and partial recovery takes 100. Our write-off property tests and the team's suite pass. Add regression tests with a sink whose `max*` return 0.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**Valid · Low · Fixed** (as recommended)

Regression: `ZeroMaxSink` (max* = 0, pays only from idle, like VaultV2). In `test_K31_BestEffortWorksWhenMaxReportsZero`, deleverage repays the 100 the sink can pay and partial recovery takes 100. `test_K31_PartialRecoveryWhenMaxReportsZero` covers RaetoVault. Both fail without the fix.

Fix: PR #34.

# [L-04] The `dustTolerance` waiver is checked per withdrawal, so a holder can split an in-loss exit and leave their gap to the holders who stay

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

When the vault is in loss, a withdrawer adds their share of the gap, "so leaving first gains nothing and the holders who stay are unaffected" (L29-31). `withdrawTo` waives the gap when it is within `dustTolerance`, and it checks that per call, on a size the caller picks. A holder can split one exit into many withdrawals whose gap is each within the tolerance, and pay almost nothing. The vault repays each part of the loan from shared USDG, so the holders who stay pay the waived gap.

The deployed vaults use a tolerance of 10 wei, where this costs more in gas than it saves. `dustTolerance` is an immutable that is chosen again at the redeploy.

## Finding Description

```solidity
uint256 owe = _toAssetsUp(repayShares);
uint256 mine = _depositorUsdgFor(shares, ts);
if (owe > mine + dustTolerance) {          // L411: per call, on a size the caller chooses
    ... // charge the gap
}
_repayShares(repayShares);                 // the vault repays `owe` from shared USDG either way
```

## Attack Path

1. The vault is in loss, for example because its sink lost value.
2. A holder repeatedly withdraws the largest amount whose `shortfallFor` is 0, with `maxShortfallIn = 0`.
3. Their total gap is about 0. The holders who stay pay it instead.

## Impact

Measured with a 1 USDG tolerance, where alice's share of the gap is 90:

|  | Alice pays | Bob (stays) pays |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Alice exits in one go | 90.00 | 90.00 |
| Alice splits her exit into 125 withdrawals | **0.00** | **180.00** |

## Likelihood

Low, and latent. It needs the vault in loss and a tolerance large relative to gas. At the deployed 10 wei it is uneconomic.

## Recommendation

Waive a rounding-size gap only while the vault is *not* in loss. When it is in loss, always charge the gap. Healthy exits then still need no USDG approval, and splitting an in-loss exit gains nothing:

```solidity
if (owe > mine) {
    uint256 gap = owe - mine;
    if (gap > dustTolerance || inLoss()) { // a healthy vault waives rounding; a vault in loss always charges
        if (gap > maxShortfallIn) revert InLoss();
        usdg.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), gap);
        emit ShortfallPaid(msg.sender, gap);
    }
}
// shortfallFor: return gap > dustTolerance || inLoss() ? gap : 0
```

`inLoss()` already allows `dustTolerance`. If the vault's whole deficit is within it, splitting can shift at most that deficit, never `dustTolerance` per call.

We first tried paying rounding-size gaps from `reserve`, but a split exit could then drain the reserve. That blocked the keeper's borrowing (`rebalance` reverts with `NoReserve`) until someone refilled it. The gate above leaves the reserve untouched.

Tested:

- The split exit now pays alice's full 90, and bob pays exactly 90 either way.
- The reserve is untouched, and `rebalance` still works.
- The team's suite passes.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**Valid · Low · Fixed** (as recommended)

`withdrawTo` and `shortfallFor` waive a rounding-size gap only while the vault is not in loss: `if (gap > dustTolerance || inLoss())`. The reserve is untouched.

Regression: `test_K32_SplitExitPaysTheWholeGap` uses `dustTolerance` = 1 USDG and splits an in-loss exit into 100 slices, each under the tolerance. Each slice is charged, and the total equals the one-shot gap. It fails without the fix.

# [I-01] The stock vault counts empty write-offs toward `MAX_WRITE_OFFS`

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

- **What happens:** `acceptDetachLoss` (L734) checks the cap before it pushes any write-off, including one that holds nothing. RaetoVault's `_writeOff` skips those first.
- **Effect:** in our test, four write-offs of empty sinks used up the cap, so the 5th `acceptDetachLoss` reverts with `TooManyWriteOffs` and exits stay paused, as in L-02.

*Fix:* record a write-off only if the vault holds shares of the sink, or can't read its balance. An empty one is still marked written off, but it isn't pushed and doesn't use the cap. With L-01's fix there is no per-claimant loop left, so the cap can also be raised. Tested: five empty write-offs no longer block the next one.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**I-01 · Fixed.** An empty sink (balance read as 0) is marked written off but not pushed, so it doesn't use the cap. A sink that can't be read is still recorded. `MAX_WRITE_OFFS` is now 8. Test: `test_K33_EmptyWriteOffsDontUseTheCap` (six empty write-offs).

# [I-02] A liquidation that repays every borrow share skips the pre-book

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

- **What happens:** `_bookLiquidation` books the equity change before a liquidation only `if (bs > 0)` (L989). The aim is to avoid valuing a loan that Morpho wrote off as bad debt. But a liquidator who repays every borrow share also reaches `bs == 0`, with collateral still left.
- **Effect:** any yield or loss since the last `accrue` then goes into the holders' liquidation claims instead of Raeto's pending yield. In our test, 89.20 USDG of unbooked sink yield went to the claimant: pending 0 and claim 989.20, against 89.20 and 900 when the yield was booked first. The same branch also lets a tiny seizure plus a gift repay move unbooked yield into claims.
- **Bound:** limited to the change since the last `accrue`.

*Fix:* Morpho writes off bad debt, and resets the borrow share price, only when no collateral is left. So pre-book, and apply the `repaid` cap, whenever collateral remains:

```solidity
bool valued = bs > 0 || live > 0;   // pass `live` from _accrue
if (valued) { /* pre-book against _toAssetsUp(exp) */ }
...
if (valued) { /* cap freed at _toAssetsDown(exp - bs) */ }
```

Tested: the full-share liquidation now books 89.20 to pending yield and 900 to the claim, the same as booking first. The tiny-seizure-plus-gift skim is gone (the holder nets 0). The full wipe with bad debt is unchanged, and our property tests and the team's suite pass.

## Team Response

Fixed.

**I-02 · Fixed** (as recommended). `_bookLiquidation(exp, bs, live)` pre-books, and caps what is freed at the repaid amount, whenever `bs > 0 || live > 0`. Test: `test_K33_FullShareLiquidationStillPreBooks` checks that a liquidation repaying every borrow share with collateral left gives the same pending yield and claim as booking first.

# [I-03] RaetoVault can re-attach a source that is still pending; writing it off then counts its shares twice

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`RaetoVault.sol`

- **What happens:** `executeSource` (L327) doesn't check `detachPending()`; RaetoStockVault's `executeSink` does. If the owner re-attaches a detached source before resolving it, then calls `acceptDetachLoss` on it (L424), the *active* source is written off.
- **Effect:** its shares are handed out in kind while `totalAssets()` still counts them and `_pay` still spends them. With two depositors of 1,000 each, the first out leaves with 2,000 and the second with 0.
- **Why Info:** it needs two unusual actions by the trusted owner.

*Fix:* in `executeSource`, add `if (detachPending()) revert Paused();` and set `retiredSource[next] = false`. In `acceptDetachLoss`, add `if (address(old) == address(source)) revert SameSource();`. I-04's fix also refuses to queue a pending source.

# [I-04] A detach freezes exits through a queued venue switch, which voids the 2-day exit window

## Severity

## Location

`RaetoVault.sol`, `RaetoStockVault.sol`

- **What happens:** the 2-day `SOURCE_DELAY`/`SINK_DELAY` exists "so users can exit first" (RaetoVault L309). But `detachSource`/`detachSink` pause every exit at once, neither cancels a queued switch, and queuing doesn't check for a pending detach. The owner can queue and detach in the same block. Exits stay frozen for the whole delay, then one batch (`redeemRetired`, then `executeSource`/`executeSink`) completes the switch.
- **Effect:** RaetoVault moved all 1,000 of principal into the new source, and the stock vault borrowed 900 into the new sink, while every exit reverted `Paused` during the delay. The live owner of every vault is a single EOA with an EIP-7702 delegation.

*Fix:* in `queueSource`/`queueSink`, add `if (detachPending()) revert Paused();`. In `detachSource`/`detachSink`, clear the queued source/sink and its eta. Then every switch starts its full delay with exits open. A multisig owner would also limit what a single key can do.
