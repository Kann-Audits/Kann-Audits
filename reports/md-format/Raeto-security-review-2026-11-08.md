# [H-01] Direct Morpho collateral donations manipulate deposit()'s share denominator, letting a dust shareholder steal later deposits

## Severity

High

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Affected components

`RaetoStockVault::deposit()`, `RaetoStockVault::withdrawTo()`, and the vault-share conversion that relies on `collateral()`.

## Summary and root cause

The share-pricing invariant is that only stock deposited through `RaetoStockVault` should affect the value represented by its shares. `deposit()` instead divides a new deposit by Morpho's live collateral balance. Morpho allows anyone to increase that balance for the vault without minting vault shares.

An attacker can retain one raw vault share, donate stock directly to the vault's Morpho position, and front-run later deposits. The donation enlarges the denominator but not `totalShares`, causing later users to receive too few shares. The attacker then redeems their old share against collateral that includes part of those users' deposits.

## Affected code

`RaetoStockVault.sol:231-241`

```solidity
uint256 coll = collateral();
uint256 ts = totalShares;
// `coll` can be increased through Morpho without minting vault shares.
shares = ts == 0 ? received : Math.mulDiv(received, ts, coll);
```

`RaetoStockVault.sol:298` later pays out stock using the same mutable live collateral balance.

## Preconditions and attack path

Attacker capabilities:

1. Deposit at least `minDeposit` stock, then withdraw all but one raw share.
2. Supply stock directly to Morpho with `onBehalf = address(vault)`.
3. Observe or front-run one or more later `deposit()` calls.

No keeper action, borrowing, oracle failure, or liquidation is required.

Cap-bounded example using the vault's 1,000,000-stock deposit cap:

1. The attacker leaves `1` raw share and `1` raw collateral unit.
2. The attacker directly supplies `100,000` stock to Morpho for the vault.
3. Four victims each deposit `200,000` stock through the vault. Each receives only one raw vault share.
4. The vault holds about `900,000` stock and has five shares. The attacker redeems one share for `180,000` stock.
5. Every victim receives only `180,000` stock when exiting, losing `20,000` stock each.

## Impact

The attacker controls the full sequence and receives an `80,000`-stock net profit after committing a `100,000`-stock donation. The four later depositors collectively lose that amount. The attack works while remaining below the configured deposit cap and requires no privileged role or adverse market condition. This is direct theft from later depositors.

## Recommended remediation

### 1. Track shareholder-owned collateral internally across all vault accounting

Replace direct reads of Morpho's raw collateral balance with an internal `shareholderCollateral` state variable (and a companion `_expCollateral` snapshot of Morpho's live balance). Having `collateral()` return `shareholderCollateral` ensures that `deposit()`, `withdrawTo()`, `sharesToStock()`, `stockOf()`, `collateralValue()`, `ltv()`, `_rebalance()`, and `closeOutWiped()` all operate strictly on vault-accounted collateral:

- **On `deposit()`:** Increment `shareholderCollateral` by `received` and update `_expCollateral` after calling `morpho.supplyCollateral()`.
- **On `withdrawTo()`:** Decrement `shareholderCollateral` by `stockOut` and call `_syncExpected()` *after* `morpho.withdrawCollateral()`.
- **On `_accrue()`:** Compare Morpho's live collateral (`_liveCollateral()`) against `_expCollateral`. If `liveColl _expCollateral` (an external donation directly to Morpho), update `_expCollateral = liveColl` without increasing `shareholderCollateral`.

### 2. Add defense-in-depth protections (`minSharesOut` and dust-share prevention)

- Add a `minSharesOut` slippage parameter (or overloaded `deposit(uint256 amount, uint256 minSharesOut)`) so depositors revert if share minting rounds unfavorably.
- Prevent partial withdrawals from leaving dust shares (`0 < totalShares < minDeposit`), or include virtual shares/assets in the `deposit()` and `sharesToStock()` conversions, so an account cannot leave `1` raw share outstanding after withdrawing `minDeposit - 1`.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, High. Fixed: shares are now priced against an internal ledger, `shareholderCollateral`, which only changes on `deposit`, `withdrawTo` and a detected liquidation, so collateral anyone supplies to Morpho on the vault's behalf can no longer move the share price. If Morpho's collateral drops below the vault's own snapshot, `_accrue` treats it as seized and clamps the ledger to what is left, with any donated surplus absorbing the seizure first. Donated stock can only be sent to the treasury, through the owner-only `sweepExcessCollateral()`. `deposit(amount, minSharesOut)` adds slippage protection. The deployed vaults are not upgradeable, so the fix ships with the redeployment; until then, deposits on empty vaults are to be paused by the owner.

# [M-01] A partial liquidation of a stock vault in loss credits more liquidation claims than it holds, and claims are paid first-come-first-served

## Severity

Medium

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

**Contract:** `RaetoStockVault.sol` L486, L614 · Reproduced on the live TSLA vault

## Summary

When Morpho liquidates part of the vault's loan, `_accrue` credits holders `freed = _toAssetsDown(exp - bs)` of liquidation claims - the full amount the liquidator repaid, with no cap. If the vault is already in loss (its USDG is below its debt), those claims exceed the USDG the vault actually holds. `_payLiquidationClaim` then pays each caller first-come-first-served, so the holder who claims first is paid in full and an identical holder who claims last is left short. The sibling full-wipe branch caps `freed` at the USDG held; the partial branch does not.

## Finding Description

```solidity
if (bs < exp) {
    uint256 freed = _toAssetsDown(exp - bs);        // L486: = what the liquidator repaid, not what we hold
    if (bs == 0) {                                   // only the full-wipe branch is capped:
        uint256 a = usdgAssets();
        freed = a > pendingYield ? a - pendingYield : 0;
    }
    ...
    liquidationPool += freed;                         // can exceed gross USDG
}
```

A liquidator repays the vault's debt with the liquidator's own USDG and seizes stock, so the vault's USDG is unchanged. Crediting `freed` of claims is backed only when the vault is whole (gross USDG ≈ debt). In loss, gross USDG `G` < debt `D`, so a repay `R` can exceed `G`, and `R - G` of the pool is phantom. `usdgAssets()` floors `gross - liquidationPool` at 0 (L183), hiding it. `_payLiquidationClaim` pays `min(owed, pool, idle)` with no pro-rata (L614).

## Attack Path

No attacker; two market conditions that share one cause. Negative carry (M-02) both pushes usdgAssets below debt *and* compounds the debt upward until LTV crosses Morpho's threshold, so a vault stuck in loss drifts into liquidation on its own.

1. The vault is in loss.
2. The stock falls and Morpho liquidates part of the loan (any liquidator).
3. The next `_accrue` credits `liquidationPool` above the vault's USDG.
4. Holder A claims (or withdraws) first and is paid in full; later holders share what is left; the last are paid nothing on a claim still shown as owed. A claim-race bot captures the gain.

## Impact

Redistribution among holders, bounded by the vault's pre-liquidation loss; late/passive claimants lose real USDG they are owed. In the PoC: pool credited 126.06 USDG against 78.09 held; on equal claims of 46.89, the first claimant takes 46.89 and the second only 31.20. This breaks the stated promise that "leaving first gains nothing and the holders who stay are unaffected."

The over-credit also outlives the holders it was issued to. `liquidationPool` is not ring-fenced, so after a full wipe and the old holders' close-out (or a keeper `unwind` and re-lever), the vault reopens with the unbacked claims still owed - then paid out of the USDG the keeper borrows against new depositors' stock. In the fork run on the empty AAPL vault, the close-out paid Alice her full 148.33 USDG but Bob only 52.02 of the same claim, leaving him owed 96.31 with 0 USDG in the vault; after the reopen Bob claimed that 96.31 out of Carol's loan, and Carol, who had deposited 1 AAPL (≈ $333), had to add 96.31 USDG to take her stock back. With a fully backed history the new depositor exits whole - so the loss can land on depositors who joined after the liquidation.

## Likelihood

Low–medium. Both preconditions are market-driven, but one cause (negative carry / compounding debt) produces both, and the race needs only a bot. Four of five markets sit at ~90% utilisation today.

## Recommendation

Cap `freed` at the vault's post-liquidation equity, not just the USDG it holds - `usdgAssets()` nets out the pool but not the debt, so subtract the remaining debt as well:

```solidity
uint256 a = usdgAssets();
if (bs == 0) {
    freed = a > pendingYield ? a - pendingYield : 0;      // full wipe: debt is 0
} else {
    uint256 reserved = pendingYield + _toAssetsUp(bs);     // treasury pending + remaining debt
    uint256 avail = a > reserved ? a - reserved : 0;
    freed = Math.min(_toAssetsDown(exp - bs), avail);
}
```

This generalises the contract's own full-wipe branch (which credits `usdgAssets() - pendingYield` at debt 0) to the partial case; in the PoC it credits 0 - correct, since the vault is still underwater (debt 126.06 > 78.09 held) - where the current code credits 126.06. Treat it as a starting point: also account for what the sink can actually withdraw, the reserve, and Morpho's share-rounding.

The uncredited loss then stays in `debt` and is shared through the withdrawal gap (order-neutral). Also ring-fence `liquidationPool` so the repay paths can't spend USDG owed to claimants, and pay `claimLiquidation` pro-rata rather than first-come-first-served.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Medium. Fixed: before a liquidation's claims are computed, `_accrue` books everything that happened before it against the loan as it stood, with any loss absorbed by `pendingYield`. `freed` is then capped at the vault's post-liquidation equity, `min(repaid, usdgAssets() - (pendingYield + debt after))`; the uncredited loss stays in the debt and is shared order-neutrally through the withdrawal gap. Claims stay at face value, and `liqScale()` gives every claim the same ratio of the USDG held, so claim order no longer matters; as the sink recovers, claims return to face value before anything counts as interest. While claims are worth less than face value, deposits and new borrowing are closed. `usdgAssets()` nets out the claims, and repay paths never spend more than `usdgAssets()`.

# [M-02] Once a stock vault is in loss, every repay path is all-or-nothing, so the debt compounds against USDG the vault holds and a holder without spare USDG can't exit

## Severity

Medium

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

**Contract:** `RaetoStockVault.sol` L352, L541, L580 · Reproduced on the live TSLA vault

## Summary

When a stock vault holds less USDG than it owes (by more than `dustTolerance`), `unwind` must repay the whole loan, `deleverage`/`rebalance` repay down to the full target, and `_ensureIdle` reverts unless the sink can produce the full amount. None repays "as much as the vault holds". So the loan keeps accruing at the market rate - high precisely when this happens - even though the vault is holding almost enough USDG to clear it. Deposits are closed, and a holder without spare USDG cannot withdraw. The only exit is outside money: `cover` the gap, then `unwind`.

## Finding Description

`unwind` is documented "repay the whole loan... when borrowing costs more than the sink pays" - the negative-carry case - and in that case it reverts:

```solidity
function unwind() external nonReentrant onlyKeeper {
    ...
    uint256 shares = morpho.position(marketId, address(this)).borrowShares;
    if (shares > 0) _repayShares(shares);   // repays ALL shares
}
// _repayShares -> _ensureIdle(fullDebt); _ensureIdle (L599): sink.withdraw(need) reverts when need > sink value + dust
```

`_rebalance` repays `d - target` and only when `ltv > maxLtv`. No path repays `min(debt, available)`. `harvest` leaves only `dust + debt/10_000` in `pendingYield`, so the buffer that keeps the vault whole runs out in hours once carry turns negative.

## Attack Path

No attacker; market-driven negative carry (one cause drives it; a sink loss does the same).

1. The market's borrow rate rises above the sink's yield (tiny markets; AdaptiveCurve compounds the rate above 90% utilisation; four of five markets are at ~90% today).
2. The harvest buffer is used up and `inLoss()` becomes true.
3. From then on, while LTV is still inside the band: `unwind` reverts, `rebalance` no-ops, `deleverage` reverts `Healthy`, `deposit`/`withdraw` revert `InLoss`, and the debt compounds.

## Impact

All holders, especially those without USDG to pay their gap. On the TSLA vault: at day 21 the vault holds 77.63 USDG against 78.86 debt (LTV 20.8%, inside the band) and every repay path fails; by day 51 the debt is 122.72 and the loss 44.83, of which ~43 USDG is interest on debt the vault held the USDG to repay. Recovery needed 2.22 USDG of outside money. This is a failure to deleverage progressively: a holder who brings USDG can still exit via `maxShortfallIn`, but one without spare USDG is stuck while the debt grows.

## Likelihood

Low–medium. Negative carry needs the borrow rate above the sink APY, which the small markets and AdaptiveCurve make reachable, but the keeper can `unwind` *before* the vault tips into loss, and `cover` ends it. The window where nothing works is the gap between those.

## Recommendation

Let `unwind` and `_rebalance`'s repay branch repay what the vault can, not all-or-nothing:

```solidity
function _repayUpTo(uint256 wantAssets) internal {
    uint256 avail = _depositorUsdgAvailable();          // idle - reserve + sink - liquidationPool - pendingYield
    uint256 amt = Math.min(wantAssets, avail);
    if (amt == 0) return;
    _ensureIdle(amt);
    usdg.forceApprove(address(morpho), amt);
    morpho.repay(marketParams(), amt, 0, address(this), "");
    usdg.forceApprove(address(morpho), 0);
}
```

Call it from `unwind` with `wantAssets = debt`, and let `deleverage` run while `inLoss()`, not only when `ltv > maxLtv`. Interest then accrues only on the real shortfall. `_depositorUsdgAvailable()` must reflect what the sink can actually withdraw right now (not just `convertToAssets`), and the repay must handle Morpho's share-rounding.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Medium. Fixed: `unwind()`, `deleverage()` and the repay branch of `_rebalance()` now go through `_repayUpTo`, which withdraws what the sink can pay now (`try`/`catch`, falling back to `maxWithdraw`), repays as much as the vault's USDG covers and emits `RepaymentDeferred` for the rest. `unwind()` closes the loan by shares when it can, using at most `dustTolerance` of the reserve. `deleverage()` can be called by anyone while the vault is in loss and repays all it can, so interest only runs on the real shortfall. `withdrawTo()` keeps the exact path, where the withdrawer approves a shortfall bound, and holders can still exit by paying their pro-rata share of what is left.

# [L-01] Recovery After Temporary Loss Double-Counts Historical earned Accounting

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoVault.sol`, `RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

When a temporary loss occurs, `_accrue()` in both `RaetoVault` and `RaetoStockVault` reduces `pendingYield` but does not adjust or track historical user credit indexes. When the lost value subsequently recovers, `_accrue()` treats the recovery as new yield, advancing `accPerPrincipal`/`accPerShare` and `totalEarned` a second time.

## Affected code

`RaetoVault.sol:405-428` and `RaetoStockVault.sol:502-522` have the same structure:

```solidity
if (equity > pending) {
    // Advances user index and totalEarned
    accPerShare += inc;
    pendingYield = pending + y;
    totalEarned += y;
} else if (equity < pending) {
    // Only pendingYield is reduced; user index and historical credits remain unchanged
    pendingYield = equity;
}
```

## Impact

`earned` and `totalEarned` are cumulative historical accounting metrics rather than net-yield metrics. If off-chain services or external reward systems grant AI inference credits based on `earned`, users receive duplicate credits for recovered losses without extra economic yield having been generated.

## Recommended remediation

Track `unrecoveredYieldLoss`. When a loss occurs, increase `unrecoveredYieldLoss`. When a subsequent recovery occurs, restore `unrecoveredYieldLoss` and `pendingYield` up to the lost amount before increasing user accrual indexes (`accPerShare` / `accPerPrincipal`) or `totalEarned`.

```diff
+ uint256 public unrecoveredYieldLoss;

  // _accrue(), when equity > pending
- uint256 y = equity - pending;
+ uint256 gain = equity - pending;
+ uint256 restored = gain < unrecoveredYieldLoss ? gain : unrecoveredYieldLoss;
+ if (restored != 0) {
+     pending += restored;
+     pendingYield = pending;
+     unrecoveredYieldLoss -= restored;
+     gain -= restored;
+ }
+ if (gain == 0) return;
- uint256 inc = Math.mulDiv(y, ACC_SCALE, ts);
+ uint256 inc = Math.mulDiv(gain, ACC_SCALE, ts);
  accPerShare += inc;
- pendingYield = pending + y;
- totalEarned += y;
+ pendingYield = pending + gain;
+ totalEarned += gain;

  // _accrue(), when equity < pending
+ unrecoveredYieldLoss += pending - equity;
  pendingYield = equity;
```

Analogous adjustments apply to `RaetoVault` using `totalPrincipal`/`accPerPrincipal` and `assets - owed`.

Regression check: credit yield, apply a temporary loss, recover exactly that loss, and assert that the user index remains at its original value.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Low. Fixed in both vaults: a new `unrecoveredLoss` records the pending yield a loss takes. A later recovery refills `pendingYield` from it first, and only value beyond that is credited to `accPerShare`/`accPerPrincipal` and `totalEarned`. `earnedIncludingPending` applies the same rule.

# [L-02] collateralValue() Delegates Zero-Price and Freshness Validation Entirely to Morpho Oracle

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

`RaetoStockVault::collateralValue()` consumes `IOracle(oracle).price()` directly without local validation for zero values, staleness, heartbeat thresholds, or sequencer uptime.

## Affected code

`RaetoStockVault.sol:186-188`:

```solidity
function collateralValue() public view returns (uint256) {
    return Math.mulDiv(collateral(), IOracle(oracle).price(), ORACLE_SCALE);
}
```

## Impact

If the external Morpho oracle adapter returns zero or corrupted stale data rather than reverting, `collateralValue()` drops to zero and `ltv()` becomes `type(uint256).max`, causing the vault to appear maximally leveraged and misrepresenting risk.

## Recommended remediation

Validate the return value of `IOracle(oracle).price()`. Add an explicit non-zero guard in `collateralValue()` and perhaps enforce a staleness check of the price. Additionally, verify that the configured Morpho oracle adapter contract internally enforces heartbeat, and L2 sequencer uptime checks (as `IOracle` exposes no round metadata).

```diff
+ error InvalidOraclePrice();

  function collateralValue() public view returns (uint256) {
-     return Math.mulDiv(collateral(), IOracle(oracle).price(), ORACLE_SCALE);
+     uint256 price = IOracle(oracle).price();
+     if (price == 0) revert InvalidOraclePrice();
+     return Math.mulDiv(collateral(), price, ORACLE_SCALE);
  }
```

Regression check: configure a test oracle that returns zero and assert that `collateralValue()` reverts with `InvalidOraclePrice` rather than returning zero and forcing `ltv()` to `type(uint256).max`.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Low. Fixed: `collateralValue()` now reverts with `BadPrice` on a zero price, and a new owner-set sanity range, `setPriceBounds(floor, ceiling)` (0 means no bound on that side; set at deployment), gates borrowing: `_rebalance` only borrows on a non-zero price inside the range. Repaying is deliberately not gated: in a real crash below the floor, deleveraging beats being liquidated, and a misprinted low price can only cost yield. Staleness is acknowledged: `IOracle` exposes no timestamp, so it cannot be checked in the vault. Morpho relies on the same oracle for liquidations, and the vault's loan-to-value band (max 38-45%) leaves a wide margin to the 62.5% LLTV. The oracle adapter's heartbeat handling is outside these contracts.

# [L-03] If the Morpho USDG vault's view reverts, RaetoVault's rescued USDG and every stock vault freeze, with no working escape

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoVault.sol`, `RaetoStockVault.sol`

**Contract:** `RaetoVault.sol` L131, L321 · `RaetoStockVault.sol` L182 (all five stock vaults) · Reproduced on the live vaults

## Summary

`totalAssets()` always values the source when one is set, even when the vault holds 0 shares. After an emergency `pullToIdle(max)` the vault holds 0 shares and all USDG sits idle, but if the source's view functions (`convertToAssets`) start reverting before the owner detaches it, every value-moving path reverts - including `goIdle()`, the function whose job is to detach the source, because it calls `_accrue()` → `totalAssets()` → the source first. The rescued idle USDG is frozen with no on-chain way out.

The stock vaults have the same dependency and no escape at all: `usdgAssets()` values the same Morpho vault (their immutable `sink`) on every path, so the same trigger freezes all five, including the holders' stock.

## Finding Description

```solidity
function totalAssets() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 idle = asset.balanceOf(address(this));
    IERC4626 s = source;
    if (address(s) == address(0)) return idle;
    return idle + s.convertToAssets(s.balanceOf(address(this))); // L131: called even when balanceOf == 0
}
```

The only way to set `source` back to zero is `goIdle()` (L319), which starts with `_accrue()` → `totalAssets()`. So the escape hatch depends on the very source it is trying to detach. `executeSource`, `pullToIdle`, `harvest`, `withdraw`, `accrue` and `claimRewards` all route through `totalAssets()` too; `sweep(USDG)` is refused with `ProtectedToken`. Nothing left can move the idle USDG.

The share balance `totalAssets()` keys on is externally writable: after `pullToIdle(max)`, anyone can `source.deposit(1, address(vault))` and hand the vault dust shares, so any recovery gated on the vault holding 0 shares can be undone by a third party for 1 wei.

## The same freeze in every RaetoStockVault

```solidity
function usdgAssets() public view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 idle = usdg.balanceOf(address(this));
    uint256 gross = (idle > reserve ? idle - reserve : 0) + sink.convertToAssets(sink.balanceOf(address(this))); // L182
    return gross > liquidationPool ? gross - liquidationPool : 0;
}
```

Every stock-vault path that moves value starts with `_accrue()` → `usdgAssets()` → `sink.convertToAssets()`. The sink is the same Morpho USDG vault, so if its view reverts, `deposit`, `withdrawTo`, `claimLiquidation`, `closeOutWiped`, `accrue`, `harvest`, `rebalance`, `deleverage` and `unwind` all revert on all five vaults. Only `cover`, `fundReserve` and `pushIdle`, which don't accrue, still go through. There is no escape hatch here: `sink` is `immutable`, so no owner function can detach it. The frozen asset also includes the holders' stock, which the broken vault doesn't even hold, because a stock exit must first repay its share of the Morpho loan from the sink. Morpho can still liquidate a frozen vault, but the vault can no longer `deleverage` to head that off.

## Attack Path

No attacker - a dependency malfunction plus an emergency state.

1. The owner reacts to trouble at the source with `pullToIdle(max)`: all USDG is now idle in the vault, which holds 0 shares. (A natural reason to hold here rather than `goIdle` immediately: to wait out the scare and `pushToSource` again if it passes.)
2. Before the owner detaches the source, the source's view functions begin reverting (e.g. a Morpho market behind its non-upgradeable adapter enters a pathological state).
3. `withdraw`, `accrue`, `harvest`, `goIdle`, `executeSource` and `claimRewards` all revert; `sweep(USDG)` is blocked. The whole vault is frozen.

## Impact

The entire vault freezes with no on-chain recovery until the source's views work again - 940.46 USDG (all depositors) on the fork. Funds are frozen, not lost; they return if the source recovers.

On the stock vaults the freeze covers the holders' stock as well as their USDG (0.688 TSLA, 0.617 NVDA and 0.474 GOOGL in the three funded vaults at block 105,639,601), with no owner recovery at all until the Morpho vault's view works again.

## Likelihood

Low. The trigger is a source *view* reverting, which no one can force (the live adapter's valuation is non-upgradeable, pure arithmetic, with no permissionless lever) and which should not happen under normal operation. It needs that rare malfunction to land in the window after `pullToIdle(max)` succeeded and before the owner detaches the source. What raises the impact is the self-bricking escape hatch: an emergency detach path that depends on the thing it detaches, with the whole vault and no recovery at stake.

The stock-vault side doesn't even need the `pullToIdle` window: the view reverting at any time is enough. That trigger is just as far out of an attacker's reach.

## Recommendation

Add an owner-only emergency detach that sets `source` to zero **without calling the source** (no `_accrue`, no valuation, no redeem), alongside the existing `goIdle()` for the clean case. It is a write-off - any shares held are abandoned (unredeemable anyway if the source's views revert), so emit them for monitoring:

```solidity
/// Emergency: stop using the source without calling it. Any shares held are written off.
function detachSource() external onlyOwner {
    IERC4626 old = source;
    if (address(old) == address(0)) revert NoSource();
    uint256 abandonedShares = old.balanceOf(address(this)); // plain ERC-20 read, not the reverting valuation
    source = IERC4626(address(0));
    asset.forceApprove(address(old), 0);                    // a USDG call, not a source call
    emit SourceDetached(address(old), abandonedShares, asset.balanceOf(address(this)));
}
```

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Low. Fixed: RaetoVault has a new owner-only `detachSource()` that sets `source` to zero without calling it (no `_accrue`, valuation or redeem) and pauses deposits. The shares are kept and stay protected from `sweep` and `claimRewards`, and `redeemRetired(source)` recovers them once the source works again. In RaetoStockVault, `sink` is no longer immutable, `detachSink()` and `redeemRetired(sink)` work the same way, and every sink call is skipped while no sink is set. While a detach is pending, exits pause so nobody leaves at a price that ignores assets that may still come back; they resume once the shares are redeemed or the owner accepts the loss with `acceptDetachLoss`. In the reported scenario the owner calls `detachSource()` and then `acceptDetachLoss(source)`, and users withdraw in full. The owner, a multisig, decides how long exits stay paused during a detach.

# [L-04] A gift-repay is misbooked as a liquidation, and cover() never accrues, so unbooked value can be redirected from the treasury to holders

## Severity

Low

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

**Contract:** `RaetoStockVault.sol` L483-491, L381 · Reproduced on a harness (real RaetoStockVault + live Morpho v1.0.0 bytecode)

## Summary

`_accrue` treats any drop in the vault's Morpho borrow shares as a liquidation and books the freed USDG to holders (`liquidationPool` / `liqAccPerShare`). It never checks that collateral was seized. Morpho `repay(onBehalf)` is permissionless, so anyone can repay the vault's debt as a gift: no collateral leaves, but the value is booked to holders instead of to the treasury as yield. Separately, `cover()` is the only balance-moving entry that does not call `_accrue`, so a top-up sits as unbooked equity. A dominant holder (share fraction f ≈ 1) can force the misbooking to redirect unbooked carry, or a third party's `cover()`, to themselves as a withdrawable claim while keeping their stock.

## Finding Description

```solidity
if (bs < exp) {                                   // L485: any drop, not just a seizure
    uint256 freed = _toAssetsDown(exp - bs);
    if (bs == 0) { uint256 a = usdgAssets(); freed = a > pendingYield ? a - pendingYield : 0; } // stale pending
    ...
    liqAccPerShare += Math.mulDiv(freed, ACC_SCALE, ts);
    liquidationPool += freed;                      // credited to holders, never to the treasury
}
```

A real liquidation seizes collateral; a gift-repay does not. `_accrue` cannot tell them apart because it never reads `collateral()`, so it books the gift as a holder liquidation-claim. Elsewhere the vault routes such inflows through `_accrue` as new equity (to `pendingYield` / yield); whether a gift should ultimately accrue to the treasury, to holders, or as a recovery contribution is a protocol-design choice - the defect is that the code decides it by misclassification rather than by intent. The sharpest case is the `bs == 0` branch: `freed = usdgAssets()` (live) `− pendingYield` (stale from the last accrue), so a full permissionless repay reaches it with no seizure and over-books the vault's unbooked sink yield - the treasury's share - into holder claims. A near-sole holder who does the repay then claims that yield in USDG and keeps all their stock (proven below). The amount is only the yield between accruals (sub-cent on-chain today), and a minority holder with fraction f still loses ≈(1−f)·debt.

## Impact

Bounded and attacker-adverse at base: repaying the vault's debt costs the attacker the full amount, and a dominant holder recovers only f of it, so the base move is a loss of (1−f)·debt. It turns profitable only against value the attacker did not provide - unbooked carry since the last accrue (any accrue resets it; ≈ +0.34 USDG was measured after 90 days on TSLA's ~77 USDG sink), or a `cover()` the attacker front-runs before it is booked. The real, fixable defects are the two code flaws themselves: value that normal yield accounting would route to the treasury can be diverted to holders. The end-to-end profitable redirection is demonstrated by the `bs == 0` variant: a sole holder's full gift-repay over-books the vault's unbooked yield (44,598 wei in the harness) into holder claims, which the holder claims and exits with - netting exactly that, with the treasury's `pendingYield` zeroed.

## Likelihood

Low. Needs a near-sole holder and unbooked value sitting in the vault at the moment of the forced drop.

## Recommendation

Distinguish a real liquidation from a gift-repay: only book `freed` when `collateral()` actually decreased - a gift-repay (no seizure) then flows through `_accrue` as ordinary yield instead of a holder claim. It is cleaner than capping `freed` at `_toAssetsDown(exp - bs)` in the `bs == 0` branch, which would under-credit a genuine full wipe (there, bad debt resets Morpho's share price and understates the repaid amount - the reason that branch already values via `usdgAssets()`). Also call `_accrue()` at the top of `cover()`, like every other balance-moving entry point.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Low. Fixed: `_accrue` only books a liquidation claim when the drop in borrow shares comes with seized collateral (live collateral below the vault's own snapshot). A gift repay now emits `GiftRepayDetected` and flows through normal equity accounting as yield. `cover()` now calls `_accrue()` first.

# [I-01] shortfallFor quotes an un-accrued gap, so passing it as maxShortfallIn reverts

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`RaetoStockVault.sol`

## Summary

When a stock vault is in loss, a holder must bring USDG to cover their share of the debt to exit. `shortfallFor(shares)` is the view the UI/integrators call to size that amount. It reads Morpho's borrow totals **without accruing interest**, while `withdrawTo` calls `_accrue()` first and charges against the higher, accrued debt. The quoted gap is therefore always a little smaller than the gap actually charged, so a caller who passes the quote verbatim as `maxShortfallIn` has the withdrawal reverted.

## Code flaw

`shortfallFor` (`RaetoStockVault.sol` L258) is a `view`, so it cannot call `morpho.accrueInterest` - it values the debt from Morpho's **stale** `totalBorrowAssets`:

```solidity
function shortfallFor(uint256 shares) public view returns (uint256) {
    ...
    uint256 owe  = _toAssetsUp(/* borrowShares for `shares` */); // stale: interest not accrued
    uint256 mine = _depositorUsdgFor(shares, ts);
    return owe > mine + dustTolerance ? owe - mine : 0;          // quoted gap
}
```

`withdrawTo` (L272) accrues first, then charges against the **accrued** (larger) debt:

```solidity
_accrue();                               // -> morpho.accrueInterest: debt grows
...
uint256 owe = _toAssetsUp(repayShares);  // accrued: larger than shortfallFor's `owe`
uint256 gap = owe - mine;
if (gap > maxShortfallIn) revert InLoss(); // L292: the quote is now too small
```

Since `mine` is unchanged, `gap(accrued) > owe(stale) − mine = shortfallFor(shares)` whenever any interest has accrued between the two calls.

## Impact

No funds at risk. A holder or integrator who sets `maxShortfallIn` from `shortfallFor` has the exit revert with `InLoss`, so exact gap-sizing from the on-chain view is unreliable. It only matters while the vault is in loss (the only time a shortfall is charged); callers who pad the quote are unaffected.

## Likelihood

High that an *exact* quote reverts - Morpho accrues interest every second, so almost any delay between the `shortfallFor` read and the `withdrawTo` transaction makes the quote stale. Overall there is no direct loss, and padding the quote (or retrying) works around it.

## Recommendation

Make the view match the charge: compute `shortfallFor` against accrued totals - use Morpho's `expectedBorrowAssets` (which projects interest to `block.timestamp`) instead of the raw `totalBorrowAssets` - or document that callers must add a small margin to the quoted gap.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Informational. Fixed: `shortfallFor` now values the debt with interest projected to the current block (`_expectedBorrowTotals()`, using the market's `borrowRateView` and the same three-term Taylor compounding Morpho uses). Within a block the quote equals what `withdrawTo` charges after `_accrue()`; across blocks it trails by the interest accrued in between, so integrators should keep a small margin.

# [I-02] claimRewards can target the vault itself, letting the owner permanently lock all governance

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`RaetoVault.sol`

## Summary

`claimRewards(target, data)` lets the owner make an arbitrary low-level call *from the vault* to collect external rewards. It blocks a few sensitive targets (USDG, the source/queued source, `address(0)`) but **not** `address(this)`. Because the call runs with the vault as `msg.sender`, the owner can route an `acceptOwnership()` through it after `transferOwnership(vault)`, making the vault its own owner. Every `onlyOwner` function then becomes permanently uncallable, and the contract's own "never renounce" guard is bypassed.

## Code flaw

`claimRewards` guards the asset and source tokens but not the vault address or no-code targets:

```solidity
function claimRewards(address target, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner nonReentrant {
    if (target == address(asset) || _isSourceToken(target) || target == address(0)) revert ProtectedToken();
    uint256 assetsBefore = totalAssets();
    (bool ok,) = target.call(data);                    // target == address(this) allowed; runs as the vault
    if (!ok) revert CallFailed();
    if (totalAssets() < assetsBefore) revert ProtectedToken();  // acceptOwnership moves no assets -> passes
}
```

Ownership is `Ownable2Step`, and renouncing is explicitly disabled, so a lock has no escape:

```solidity
/// @notice Ownership can be transferred but never renounced (emergency functions need an owner).
function renounceOwnership() public view override onlyOwner { revert Disabled(); }
```

Sequence (both calls are `onlyOwner`):

1. `transferOwnership(address(vault))` → `_pendingOwner = vault`.
2. `claimRewards(address(vault), abi.encodeWithSelector(Ownable2Step.acceptOwnership.selector))` → the vault calls its own `acceptOwnership()` as `msg.sender == pendingOwner` → `_owner = vault`.

## Impact

Permanent, irrecoverable governance lock. With the vault as its own owner, no human can call any `onlyOwner` function again - `setKeeper`, `queueSource`/`executeSource`, `goIdle`, `pullToIdle`, `sweep`, `claimRewards` itself, the treasury/param setters - so the owner-only emergency paths are dead (keeper-only functions still work). `renounceOwnership` reverts and `transferOwnership` is `onlyOwner`, so there is no recovery. Verified on a fork: after the two calls, `owner() == address(vault)`.

## Likelihood

Low. Both steps are `onlyOwner`, so it is not reachable by an outsider - it is an owner-footgun / missing-input-validation issue, not an external attack. But the result is permanent and irrecoverable, which is why the one-line guard is worth adding (and it matters more if the owner key is ever compromised).

## Recommendation

Reject `target == address(this)` (and `target.code.length == 0`) in `claimRewards`, alongside the existing protected-token checks, so a reward call can never re-enter the vault's own privileged surface.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Informational. Fixed: `claimRewards` now also rejects `target == address(this)` and any target with no code, alongside the protected tokens, so a reward call can no longer reach the vault's own privileged functions.
