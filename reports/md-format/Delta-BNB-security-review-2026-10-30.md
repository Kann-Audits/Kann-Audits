# [L-01] Pause and fee-rate changes are no longer atomic across the protocol - the two manager halves can run divergent configuration

## Severity

Low

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L471`, `DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L482`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L485`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L496`

## Summary

Pausing the protocol and changing the fee rate no longer take effect protocol-wide in one transaction. The two manager halves hold independent copies of the configuration, so pause everything is two separate transactions against two different contracts and between them, one Uniswap generation can stay fully open (or keep collecting at the old fee rate) while the operator believes the change applied everywhere. During an incident this defeats the purpose of the pause: the first transaction succeeds, which reads as "pause worked", while capital keeps entering the other half. On-chain config was in parity at review time (`feeBps` 750 on both, nothing paused, same owner 0xb1c2…9e69, same treasury and keeper, `rewardsRoot` 0) - the finding is the window every future config change is forced to pass through. Origin: **split-introduced** - the core regression of the split. Not attacker-exploitable: beneficiary exit rights are unconditional in both halves and a fee change within `MAX_FEE_BPS` is within owner authority; this is an operational/atomicity finding about a guarantee the single contract provided for free.

**Root cause**

`openPaused`, `feeBps`, `treasury`, `keeper` and `rewardsRoot` are declared, set and enforced independently in each half, with no cross-contract read in either direction - no shared controller, beacon, or config mirror. Before the split, a single transaction paused capital entry for both Uniswap generations and one fee change applied protocol-wide, atomically. After the split, the protocol can occupy a state the original single contract could never express: one generation paused, the other still accepting capital.

## Affected code

- `src/DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L471-L477` - `setOpenPaused()` writes V3's own `openPaused` storage; enforced at `src/DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L533` (opens) and #L843 (deposits).
- `src/DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L485-L491` - independent `setOpenPaused()` writing V4's own storage; enforced at `src/DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol`#L570, #L809, #L1023.
- `src/DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol`#L482-L491 and `src/DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol`#L496-L507 - independent `setFeeBps()`; fee applies immediately to all fees not yet collected, including accruals on already-open positions (the files' own invariant 4).
- Neither file reads the other's storage anywhere; `OpenPausedSet/FeeBpsSet` topics (`src/DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L303, #L306; src/DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L317`) are only comparable off-chain - no on-chain divergence detection exists.

## Impact

- **Half-pause window during incidents**. Between the two `setOpenPaused(true)` transactions, one half reverts `OpensPaused()` while the other keeps accepting capital. The first transaction succeeds, which reads as "pause worked"; an operator pausing under time pressure has no on-chain signal the other half is still open. New capital continues entering the `unpaused` generation while the responder believes entry is closed protocol-wide.

- **Fee-rate divergence window**. Until the second `setFeeBps` lands, the same pool type is charged different protocol cuts depending on which generation the position lives on (e.g. V3 rung collecting at 750 bps, identical V4 position at the new rate). The two transactions are independent and can land in different blocks, so the window is unbounded; divergence is user-visible in `FeesCollected` events because `_skim` rounds per collection.

- Divergent treasury/keeper between halves is likewise possible and only discoverable off-chain.

- Conditions: any future pause or fee change (every config change passes through the window); no attacker required.

## Proof of concept

1. Owner calls `DeltaLadderManagerV3.setOpenPaused(true)`. Tx confirms; `OpenPausedSet(true)` emitted by V3 only.
2. A user calls `DeltaLadderManagerV4.openV4(...)` for the same Delta pool family. It succeeds `openPaused` in V4's storage is still false (V4 #L570 reads V4 storage only).
3. Owner calls `DeltaLadderManagerV4.setOpenPaused(true)` in a later block. Until then, V4 accepted capital during a declared pause. Symmetrically, `setFeeBps(900)` on V3 only leaves V4 collections at 750 bps until a second transaction lands.

## Recommendation

- Ops (do now): a runbook that treats the two managers as one unit - config changes are always back-to-back transactions, same block where possible plus a monitoring job that diffs `OpenPausedSet / FeeBpsSet / TreasurySet` topics across both addresses and alerts on divergence.

- Code (future revision): a shared pause/config controller both halves read, or a minimal `assertConfigParity()` view used by deploy tooling. Note both halves are immutable/non-proxy, so this is a next-deployment item, not a patch.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Agree, Low. Same owner key, updated together.

# [L-02] No token allowlist: a rebasing token's backing shortfall bricks every claim and exit in that token, for all users

## Severity

Low

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L980`, `DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L987`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L946`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L953`

## Summary

The protocol enforces no allowlist on position tokens, so a rebasing or slashable token can enter management permissionlessly and later freeze all funds flows in that token. Since `executePayout` and `_payErc20`'s catch branch both enforce `balanceOf(this) >= totalOwed[token] + accruedProtocolFees[token]`, any balance below recorded reserves (from a negative rebase, slashing, or any accounting deficit) fails the check in both the try and the catch, so every nonzero push in that token reverts - blocking `claim`/`claimFor` for credit holders AND the harvest-coupled exits of every position holding that token. The only exit left is owner-gated `releaseNft`.

## Affected code

```solidity
function _requireBacking(address token) internal view {
    if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) < totalOwed[token] + accruedProtocolFees[token]) {
        revert InsufficientBacking(token);
    }
}

function _payErc20(address token, address to, uint256 amount) internal {
    if (amount == 0) return;
    try this.executePayout{gas: ERC20_PAYOUT_GAS}(token, to, amount) {}
    catch {
        uint256 reserved = totalOwed[token] + amount;
@>        if (IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) < reserved + accruedProtocolFees[token]) {
            revert InsufficientBacking(token);   // the "deferral" fallback reverts on the SAME deficit
        }
        owed[to][token] += amount;
        totalOwed[token] = reserved;
        emit PayoutDeferred(to, token, amount);
    }
}
```

(`executePayout` itself ends in `_requireBacking(token)`, so with a deficit the try always fails and the catch always reverts.)

## Impact

One token's deficit (even 1 wei below reserves) freezes all user flows in that token across all positions until someone donates the shortfall. No attacker required; a rebasing token does it on its own. In this state the documented invariant 2 ("user funds are never owner-lockable") does not hold: the only escape is owner-gated `releaseNft`.

The deficit also disables the contract's own safety mechanism. The deferred-credit fallback - invariant 8's promise that "failed ERC20 deliveries become backed beneficiary credits" - re-checks the same reserve inequality in its catch branch, so it is unreachable in exactly the state it was designed to handle: the payout and its failure handler share the failure condition, leaving no graceful-degradation path.

## Proof of concept

### Attack Path

1. `DeltaLadderManagerV3` accepts any position transferred to it via `safeTransferFrom` while opens are unpaused: `onERC721Received` verifies only that the NFT comes from the canonical NPM, with no check on the pool's tokens. So a position in a rebasing/slashable token (call it REB) comes under management without the owner ever opting in.
2. After the first harvest the manager holds REB exactly equal to `totalOwed[REB] + accruedProtocolFees[REB]` with no slack: the skimmed protocol cut alone creates this exact-backing state (any deferred credit adds to it wei-for-wei), and it is the protocol's normal resting state between owner sweeps.
3. The manager's REB balance drops in place due to a negative rebase, a slashing event, or issuer confiscation of a blacklisted holder's funds. Even 1 wei puts the balance below the unchanged reserve: `balanceOf(this)` < `totalOwed[REB]` + `accruedProtocolFees[REB]` is a strict <.
4. Anyone with a deferred REB credit can no longer `claim` as `_claim` checks `balanceOf >= reserve` before paying, and that check now fails.
5. All harvest-coupled exits (`collect`/`close`/`decrease`/`withdraw`) of every REB position revert: the push hits `_payErc20`, whose try and catch both fail the same check. Fresh fees cannot cure it - each harvest pays out what arrived minus the skim, and the skim grows the reserve, so the deficit persists.
6. The token is frozen for all users until someone donates the shortfall; the only per-position escape is owner-gated `releaseNft`.

## Recommendation

Contain a deficit to the credit ledger instead of bricking every flow in the token: require only that a payout does not *increase* the deficit (snapshot `reserve − balance` per operation), so harvests of fresh receipts - which leave the deficit unchanged - still deliver, while `_claim` stays strict since it pays out of the shared reserve. This mirrors the skip-on-deficit pattern `sweepTokens` already uses. At minimum, document that rebasing/slashable tokens must not be managed, or enforce a token allowlist at `onERC721Received`.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, Low. Needs a shrinking-balance token, which Uniswap doesn't support either. A top-up restores claims, and we're adding a balance monitor.

# [L-03] releaseNft lets a beneficiary who controls their own pool's token or hook evade feeBps entirely

## Severity

Low

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L1098`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L1190`

## Summary

`releaseNft` is the only exit path that can return custody of a managed position without a successful fee harvest. Every other exit calls the harvest directly with no try/catch, so a harvest failure reverts the whole call. `releaseNft` wraps its harvest (`settleForRelease`) in a gas-capped `try/catch {}` and transfers the NFT regardless of outcome, setting `settled = false` on any failure with no further check.

A beneficiary who deploys their own token (V3) or V4 hook can make the harvest fail *only when the manager calls it*, forcing every other exit shut, then use `requestRelease` + the owner's routine countersignature on `releaseNft` to get the NFT back unsettled, with fees still sitting in the position, and collect them directly afterward. The protocol's `feeBps` cut is never taken.

Confirmed reachable: there is no contract-level whitelist on pools, tokens, or hooks for `openV3`/`openV4`. Per the client (Scoopz, 2026-10-23): "Our app only offers hookless pools on BNB and Base, but anyone can call `openV4` directly with any hook." The app's own frontend curates a safe set; the contract itself does not enforce it.

## Affected code

Split V3 half, `src/DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol`: `openV3` L526, `collectV3Batch` L593, `withdrawV3Batch` L1014, `transferBeneficiary` L1039, `requestRelease` L1067, `releaseNft` L1098, `settleForRelease` L1138, `RELEASE_SETTLE_GAS` L149.

Split V4 half, `src/DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol`: `openV4` L564, `withdrawV4Batch` L1102, `transferBeneficiary` L1131, `requestRelease` L1159, `releaseNft` L1190, `settleForRelease` L1229, `RELEASE_SETTLE_GAS` L149.

This logic is shared by both contracts, so it affects the V3 and V4 managers identically.

## Impact

Attack construction (V3): deploy an ERC20 with an admin-toggleable blacklist (the realistic shape - mirrors live compliance-blacklist tokens like USDT, where the admin adds/removes addresses at will, rather than a hardcoded block). Pair it with any token in a V3 pool, open a managed ladder normally through `openV3` (the deposit itself must not be blocked yet, or the open reverts). Once open, flip the blacklist on against the manager's own address. Every manager-mediated `collect()` now reverts, so `collectV3Batch`, `closeV3Batch`, `decreaseV3Batch`, `withdrawV3Batch`, and `transferBeneficiary` all fail for this position. The only path left is `requestRelease` -> `releaseNft`. The owner, following the contract's own documented intended behavior for a stuck harvest, calls `releaseNft`. The settle attempt reverts cleanly (well within `RELEASE_SETTLE_GAS`, not an OOG-griefing case), `settled = false`, and the NFT transfers to the attacker with the full fee balance still embedded (an NPM `collect()` revert is atomic, so `tokensOwed` is untouched). The attacker, now the direct NFT owner, calls `collect()` themselves; the blacklist never applied to them, so they receive 100% of the fees.

Attack construction (V4, cheaper): no custom token needed. Deploy a hook that reverts `beforeRemoveLiquidity` only when `sender == address(manager)`, allowing it for the true owner. `openV4` applies no constraint on `hooks`. Same shape, same result.

Why this is more than the previously acknowledged issue about hooks permanently locking a position (resolved by adding this same release mechanism): that fix addressed an honest, non-malicious hook or token accidentally bricking a position. What's found here is the beneficiary deliberately engineering the same failure, selectively, only against the manager's own calls, turning the rescue path into a `feeBps` bypass available on demand.

## Proof of concept

`test/ForkReleaseFeeEvasion.t.sol`. Run with:

```bash
BSC_RPC=https://bsc-rpc.publicnode.com forge test --match-path test/ForkReleaseFeeEvasion.t.sol -vvv
```

Result: PASS. Runs against the live `DeltaLadderManagerV3` on a BNB fork (`0x17425c9e2e4f2ef88736e9df578c169153444da4`; sanity-checked by reading `owner()` off the fork and matching the known owner EOA), not a redeploy, so this reproduces production bytecode exactly.

Steps, all against the live contract:

1. Deploy `ToggleableBlacklistToken` (admin-controlled blacklist), pair with WBNB in a real Uniswap V3 pool (fee 3000), initialize at 1:1.
2. Call `openV3` on the live manager. Succeeds, mints real on-chain liquidity.
3. Call `setBlacklisted(manager, true)` on the attacker's own token.
4. Real swap (evil -> WBNB) through the position's range accrues real trading fees denominated in the now-blacklisted token.
5. `manager.collectV3Batch([tokenId], ...)` reverts (`blacklisted recipient`) - confirms every ordinary exit is blocked.
6. `requestRelease` (attacker), then `releaseNft` pranked as the real owner EOA (the contract's own normal operational flow) - succeeds. NFT transfers to the attacker.
7. `accruedProtocolFees[evil] == 0` after release - the protocol's cut was never booked.
8. Attacker calls `collect()` directly as the new NPM owner. Succeeds, pays out `31006609479716532` wei of the evil token. Zero to the protocol.

## Recommendation

`releaseNft` could skim at the current on-chain `tokensOwed`/accrued-fee reading even when the push fails, crediting the protocol's cut via the `owed`/`accruedProtocolFees` ledgers instead of skipping the skim entirely on any harvest failure. Note the position is no longer managed post-release, so the manager has no way to actually collect on that claim once the NFT leaves custody, so this alone does not fully close the gap.

A more complete fix: before honoring an unsettled release, verify the harvest failure is not selectively targeted at the manager. For example, simulate the same `collect`/`removeLiquidity` call as if the caller were the position's beneficiary (a static call from that context) and only allow the unsettled path through if that would also fail. This is harder to implement cleanly on-chain but closes the "fails only for us" asymmetry the whole exploit depends on.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, Low. Releases are owner-sent, and our release tool holds any that would skip the fee.

# [L-04] A blocklisted beneficiary can never recover deferred payouts

## Severity

Low

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L959`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L925`

## Summary

When delivery fails, `_payErc20` defers the amount into `owed[beneficiary][token]`. The only recovery paths, `claim` and owner-called `claimFor`, retry the identical `safeTransfer` to the same recorded beneficiary; `claimRewards`/`claimRewardsFor` likewise pay only the account baked into the Merkle leaf. No path can redirect to an alternate receiver, so a blocklisted beneficiary's credits are undeliverable for as long as the block lasts, and their `totalOwed` reservation permanently depresses `unallocatedBalance`.

## Affected code

recovery retries the same recipient; no redirection parameter exists anywhere:

```solidity
function _claim(address beneficiary, address token) internal {
    uint256 amount = owed[beneficiary][token];
    if (amount == 0) return;
    _requireBacking(token);
    owed[beneficiary][token] = 0;
    totalOwed[token] -= amount;
@>    this.executePayout(token, beneficiary, amount);   // retries the SAME blocked recipient
    emit PayoutClaimed(beneficiary, token, amount);
}
```

## Impact

Stranded user value and a permanently inflated `totalOwed` reserve for the token. The no-redirection design is deliberate (the owner cannot steer user funds) but leaves no user-signed escape either.

## Proof of concept

### Attack Path

Precondition: the position pays out a recipient-checked blocklist token (USDC-style).

1. Alice is the recorded beneficiary of a managed position, and Circle blacklists her address.
2. A harvest or close pays her in USDC; the `safeTransfer` reverts, so `_payErc20` defers the amount into `owed[alice][USDC]` and the funds stay in the manager.
3. Alice calls `claim(USDC)`, which retries the same `safeTransfer` to her blocked address and reverts.
4. The owner calls `claimFor(alice, USDC)`, which pays only the recorded beneficiary and reverts the same way.
5. `transferBeneficiary` and `releaseNft` move only the position, never the existing `owed` credit.
6. No other path (rewards root, `sweepTokens`, external `executePayout`) can touch the reservation.

End state: the credit is fully backed but undeliverable by anyone until the address is unlisted.

## Recommendation

Add a beneficiary-signed redirection for deferred credits only (e.g. `claimTo(token, receiver)` callable by the credit holder), preserving the owner-cannot-redirect property while giving a blocklisted user an exit.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, by design. Payouts only go to the beneficiary, and redirecting would bypass the issuer's freeze. Won't fix.

# [I-01] No contract-side slippage floor on opens; deployed with all price protection disabled, every open is sandwich-able on the BNB public mempool

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L526`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L564`

## Summary

The `openV3` function delegates all price protection to two caller-supplied inputs: the `[minSqrtPriceX96, maxSqrtPriceX96]` band and the `amount0Min`/`amount1Min`. The contract itself doesn't enforce any floor of its own. BNB Chain has a public mempool, so an open without price protection can be sandwiched.

On a public mempool an attacker front-runs the `openV3` to move the pool price, the victim's deposit mints at that manipulated price (no check rejects it), and the attacker restores the price in a back-run. The victim's freshly minted position is worth materially less at the true price than the capital they put in, and the attacker keeps the difference.

## Affected code

The band is forwarded to the builder and the rung mins to the NPM exactly as the caller passes them; nothing rejects a full-range band or a zero min:

```solidity
function openV3(
    address pool,
    IDeltaPositionBuilder.Rung[] calldata rungs,   // each Rung carries amount0Min / amount1Min
    uint160 minSqrtPriceX96,
    uint160 maxSqrtPriceX96,
    uint256 deadline
) external payable nonReentrant returns (uint256[] memory tokenIds) {
    ...
    // caller-supplied band and rung mins are the ONLY price protection; no floor is enforced here
    tokenIds = v3Builder.mintLadder{value: msg.value}(pool, rungs, minSqrtPriceX96, maxSqrtPriceX96, deadline);
    ...
}
```

The `openV4` follows the same assumption (it has no price-band parameter at all, only the per-rung `amount0Max`/`amount1Max` ceilings).

## Impact

Direct loss of a depositor's capital on every open, to an attacker.

## Recommendation

Ship the client with a tight band and non-zero rung mins derived from a fresh quote at send time. Optionally, have the contract reject the degenerate combination of a full-range band with all-zero mins, or document prominently that integrators must supply real bounds on public-mempool chains.

## Team Response

Acknowledged, Info. On BNB the app sends a tight band from a fresh price, and we're capping opens at 1%.
