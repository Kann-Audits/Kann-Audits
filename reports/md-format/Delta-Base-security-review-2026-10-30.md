# [M-01] A callback token makes `openV4` record NFTs the manager does not hold, letting the attacker take a later holder's position

## Severity

Medium

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L578-L592`

## Summary

`openV4` finds the ids it minted by reading `posm.nextTokenId()` before and after the mint. The second read comes after `_disarmPermit2` calls `approve` on each pool token, when the posm is already unlocked, so a pool token can mint its own NFTs in between. The manager records those ids too: the attacker becomes the beneficiary of NFTs the attacker holds.

The record is never checked against custody and stays with the token id. If such an NFT later reaches another user who adds value and then moves it into the manager with a plain `transferFrom`, or approves the manager on it, the attacker closes it and takes everything. The owner cannot return it.

## Finding Description

**Security property.** A beneficiary record exists only for an NFT the manager holds (V4 L231), and only the NFT's real holder can control it through the manager.

**Root cause.** The range of recorded ids is read after pool-token code has run:

```solidity
uint256 firstId = v4Posm.nextTokenId();                                          // L578
v4Posm.modifyLiquidities{value: m.native ? msg.value : 0}(unlockData, deadline); // L580: posm lock released on return
if (!m.native) _disarmPermit2(key.currency0);                                    // L583: raw token.approve(permit2, 0) (L1439)
_disarmPermit2(key.currency1);                                                   // L584
uint256 mintedThrough = v4Posm.nextTokenId();                                    // L585: includes NFTs the token minted
...
v4Beneficiary[id] = m.owner;                                                     // L592
```

The posm lock only blocks a second mint while the manager's own `modifyLiquidities` is running. Once it returns, the token's `approve` can call `posm.modifyLiquidities` itself and mint to any address.

Three properties turn the false record into a credential:

- `_requireOwner` (L1270-1273) checks the map only, never who holds the NFT.
- `rescueNft` refuses any id that has a record (L515), so the owner cannot return it.
- Only a `safeTransferFrom` deposit overwrites the record (`_recordV4Deposit`, L789-790). A plain `transferFrom` skips the receiver hook, and an approval needs no transfer at all.

## Attack Path

1. The attacker deploys a token whose `approve(permit2, 0)`, when called by the manager, mints NFTs to the attacker through the posm.
2. The attacker opens a one-rung ladder in a pool with that token. The manager records the attacker as beneficiary of its own NFT and of every NFT the callback minted.
3. One of those NFTs reaches a victim: sold on a secondary market, or given.
4. The victim adds liquidity to it, then moves it into the manager with a plain `transferFrom`, or approves the manager on it.
5. The attacker calls `closeV4Batch` on it and receives all of its liquidity. `rescueNft` reverts with `NftStillManaged`.

## Impact

- **Theft of another user's position.** The victim loses everything in the position when it reaches the manager: what they paid for it and what they added. In the PoC the victim adds 59.1e18 of each token and the attacker takes 59.1e18 of each, by either route.
- **Pause bypass.** A ghost NFT moved in with a plain `transferFrom` becomes a managed position while opens are paused. The pause is checked only in `openV4` (L570) and the receiver hook (L809).
- **Wrong records for other users.** Anyone who opens in a pool containing the attacker's token gets the ghost ids recorded under them and pays for the attacker's mints: about 115k gas per ghost (2.65M gas with 20, against 345k).
- **Rewards split, no victim action.** `ownerOfV4`/`v4Managed` report a ghost as a normal managed position (they never check custody), which is the source the contract tells integrators to read for the Merkl reward split. A root built from it attributes the pooled rewards to the ghost's recorded beneficiary. Since backing is pooled, the ghost's leaf is honoured out of a real beneficiary's share, who can then no longer be paid. This route needs no victim, and its ceiling is the manager's whole reward pool per token. Latent today (`rewardsRoot` is 0) and it relies on the off-chain root builder trusting the documented view.
- **Production.** The V4 manager is live and unpaused on Base and BNB, with identical bytecode (24,248 B). The theft needs no funds already in the manager, because the victim brings the value.

## Likelihood

Low. The attacker cannot force the loss: it needs a victim who holds one of the attacker's NFTs and then takes one of two actions that no Delta flow uses. A holder who ignores the NFT is unaffected, and one who deposits it through the app (`safeTransferFrom`) overwrites the record. The impact falls on another user's funds with no recovery, which the client's rules rate in full, so the combined rating is Medium.

## Proof of Concept

`test/report/M01_GhostRecord.t.sol`: one test on a Base fork at block 53,225,979, against the live V4 manager `0xc774edbeaf3e190b8fe9b9ebc753b58408949430`, posm `0x7c5f5a4bbd8fd63184577525326123b519429bdc` and PoolManager `0x498581ff718922c3f8e6a244956af099b2652b2b`. It walks the impacts in order: the planted records, another opener's ghost records, theft by plain transfer, theft by approval, and the pause bypass.

Call order inside the attacker's `openV4`, from the `-vvvv` trace. The callback's `modifyLiquidities` succeeds, which shows the posm is unlocked when the token's `approve` runs:

```solidity
openV4
├─ posm.nextTokenId()                     → firstId
├─ posm.modifyLiquidities(…)              the manager's own mint
│    └─ mint 3176609 → manager
├─ CallbackToken.approve(permit2, 0)      _disarmPermit2
│    └─ posm.modifyLiquidities(…)         succeeds: posm is unlocked
│         ├─ mint 3176610 → attacker
│         ├─ mint 3176611 → attacker
│         └─ mint 3176612 → attacker
├─ posm.nextTokenId()                     → mintedThrough, read after the callback
└─ ManagedOpenV4(tokenIds: [3176609, 3176610, 3176611, 3176612])
```

## Recommendation

Read the range before any token call:

```solidity
v4Posm.modifyLiquidities{value: m.native ? msg.value : 0}(unlockData, deadline);
uint256 mintedThrough = v4Posm.nextTokenId();
if (!m.native) _disarmPermit2(key.currency0);
_disarmPermit2(key.currency1);
```

As a second safeguard, record an id only if `IERC721(address(v4Posm)).ownerOf(id) == address(this)`. The read-order change closes the window; the ownership check stops a false record even if the mint flow changes later.

## Team Response

Fixed.

Confirmed, Medium. No app or keeper flow moves or approves a position NFT, so both theft routes need the victim to act outside the app. `rewardsRoot` is zero, and any root we build starts from positions the manager actually holds. The next deployment reads the id range first and checks custody, as you suggested.
# [L-01] V4 Fee-Harvest Callback Bypass

## Severity

Low

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L754`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L760`

Affected logic: `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol` - `_collectSkimV4`, `_harvestV4`, `withdrawV4Batch`, and related V4 operations

## Summary

`_collectSkimV4` collects a position’s fees, records the protocol cut, and returns the beneficiary’s remainder. `_harvestV4` then pays that remainder through `_pushV4`, which can invoke a contract beneficiary’s ETH callback. If that callback donates the payout back into the same pool, it creates new fee growth after the manager’s collection and accounting snapshot. During `withdrawV4Batch`, the manager then transfers the still-open NFT. The recipient’s ERC-721 callback can collect the new fees directly from PositionManager, bypassing the manager’s skim path. The callback calls PoolManager and PositionManager; it does not need to re-enter Delta.

## Preconditions

- The beneficiary is a contract that can receive ETH, call PoolManager, and receive the position NFT.
- The beneficiary controls a manager-custodied V4 position with a nonzero share of a pool that accepts native ETH.
- The position has fees to harvest, so the manager makes an ETH payout during withdrawal.

## Steps to reproduce

1. On a Base fork, deploy the reviewed `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol` source locally and use Base’s deployed V4 PoolManager (`0x498581fF718922c3f8e6A244956aF099B2652b2b`) and PositionManager (`0x7C5f5A4bBd8fD63184577525326123B519429bDc`).
2. Create a hookless native-ETH/ERC-20 pool (fee tier 3000, tick spacing 60) and open a position through Delta for a beneficiary contract implementing both `receive()` and `onERC721Received()`.
3. Generate fees in the position, for example with a 0.5 ETH exact-input swap.
4. Arm the beneficiary’s `receive()` callback, then have the beneficiary call `withdrawV4Batch` for the position.
5. When Delta pays the harvested ETH, use the callback to call `PoolManager.unlock`. In the unlock callback, donate the received ETH to the same pool and settle it. This creates fee growth after Delta has collected fees and updated `accruedProtocolFees`.
6. Let `withdrawV4Batch` continue. When the NFT arrives, use `onERC721Received()` to call PositionManager’s `modifyLiquidities` with a zero-liquidity decrease followed by `TAKE_PAIR`, directing the proceeds to the beneficiary.
7. Compare the beneficiary’s balance and Delta’s fee ledger before and after. The beneficiary receives the newly accrued amount, while `accruedProtocolFees` remains at its value from the initial harvest.

## Observed result

1. In the integration run, a 0.5 ETH swap generated 0.0015 ETH in fees. Delta recorded 0.000015 ETH as its cut and paid 0.001485 ETH to the beneficiary. The beneficiary donated that payout during the callback and collected 0.001484999999999998 ETH after receiving the NFT; Delta’s ledger remained at 0.000015 ETH.
2. The donation comes from the beneficiary’s own payout. This confirms a fee-bypass path, but does not by itself establish net profit or theft of another LP’s funds.

## Related-path

1. The same callback window was reproduced for a WETH-quoted position.
2. On close and partial decrease, callback-created fee growth was included in the later balance delta and paid with the operation’s proceeds without another skim.
3. On top-up, the growth was available during increase settlement without another skim.
4. A plain collect did not bypass the cut permanently: a subsequent ordinary collection skimmed the deferred fees.
5. An EOA route was reproduced only with a callback-enabled, nonstandard ERC-20; it is a lower-likelihood variant and is not needed for the native-ETH path above.

## Suggested remediation

Avoid paying a beneficiary while the position remains in a state where a later managed operation or custody transfer can process newly created fee growth. Defer beneficiary payouts until the relevant operation or NFT transfer is complete, or perform a final collect-and-skim after the callback window before treating subsequent proceeds as principal.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Acknowledged, Low. Only fees the beneficiary creates inside its own callback skip the cut, so no one else is affected. The next deployment pays out after the last step.
# [I-01] Permanent position lock: `transferBeneficiary` accepts the manager's own address, stranding the position with no recovery path

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L1039`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L1131`

## Target

- `DeltaLadderManagerV3` - Base `0x17425c9E2e4F2Ef88736E9Df578C169153444dA4` (demonstrated)
- `DeltaLadderManagerV4` - Base `0xc774edbEaf3e190b8fE9B9EBC753b58408949430` (same gap in source, not dynamically tested)
- Audited revision: `8cdb069e0f8e11c09e109174522392348fecd6b1`
- Validated on a local fork of Base mainnet (chain `8453`) at block `53202000`, against the deployed contract.

## Summary

`transferBeneficiary` rejects a zero recipient but accepts the manager's own address. Once the beneficiary record points at the manager, the position becomes permanently inaccessible:

- the former beneficiary can no longer call any beneficiary-gated function (all revert `NotBeneficiary`), and the manager has no path that calls its own beneficiary-gated entry points;
- the owner cannot recover it either - `rescueNft` reverts `NftStillManaged` because the record is non-zero, and `releaseNft` reverts `ReleaseNotRequested` because the handover cleared any request.

The position NFT, its remaining principal and all future fees are locked in the manager with no recovery path through the deployed interface.

## Root cause

`transferBeneficiary` (V3), L1039 validates only `to != address(0)`:

```solidity
function transferBeneficiary(Version version, uint256 tokenId, address to, bytes calldata hookData, uint256 deadline)
    external
    nonReentrant
{
    _checkDeadline(deadline);
    if (to == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress(); // AUDIT: to == address(this) is still accepted
    if (version != Version.V3 && version != Version.V4) revert BadVersion();
    Managed memory m = _requireBeneficiary(version, tokenId);
    if (version == Version.V3) {
        _harvestV3(tokenId, m);
        v3Beneficiary[tokenId] = to; // AUDIT: the manager becomes its own beneficiary
    } else {
        revert BadVersion();
    }
    delete releaseRequests[version][tokenId]; // AUDIT: clears any release request
    emit BeneficiaryTransferred(version, tokenId, m.owner, to);
}
```

The record is the sole source of authority. `_requireOwner`, L1179:

```solidity
function _requireOwner(Version version, uint256 tokenId) internal view returns (address beneficiary) {
    beneficiary = version == Version.V3 ? v3Beneficiary[tokenId] : v4Beneficiary[tokenId];
    if (beneficiary == address(0)) revert NotManaged(tokenId);
    if (beneficiary != msg.sender) revert NotBeneficiary(msg.sender, beneficiary); // AUDIT: no caller can be the manager
}
```

Neither recovery lever works once the record is the manager:

- `rescueNft`, L495 reverts `NftStillManaged` for any non-zero record (by design - it may only move stranded, unmanaged NFTs);
- `releaseNft`, L1098 needs a release request from the current beneficiary, which the handover deleted.

`transferBeneficiary` (V4), L1131 has the identical self-destination gap.

## Preconditions

The current beneficiary sets the recipient of `transferBeneficiary` to the manager's own address - realistically an integration or UI passing the wrong address. No attacker and no owner action is involved.

## Proof of concept

Runnable Foundry test against the **deployed** V3 manager on a Base fork: `test/fork/TransferBeneficiaryTrap.t.sol`. It opens a funded V3 WETH/USDC position through the manager, generates fees via swaps, performs the self-transfer, and then checks every stated recovery attempt:

```solidity
vm.prank(alice);
MGR_V3.transferBeneficiary(DeltaLadderManagerV3.Version.V3, id, address(MGR_V3), "", block.timestamp);
assertEq(MGR_V3.ownerOfV3(id), address(MGR_V3)); // record is now the manager

// owner recovery attempts both fail:
vm.prank(OWNER);
vm.expectRevert(DeltaLadderManagerV3.NftStillManaged.selector);
MGR_V3.rescueNft(DeltaLadderManagerV3.Version.V3, id, alice);

vm.prank(OWNER);
vm.expectRevert(DeltaLadderManagerV3.ReleaseNotRequested.selector);
MGR_V3.releaseNft(DeltaLadderManagerV3.Version.V3, id, "");
```

The owner is impersonated only to show that even authorized recovery fails; no owner action is needed to create the locked state.

Run:

```solidity
BASE_FORK_BLOCK=53202000 forge test \
  --match-path test/fork/TransferBeneficiaryTrap.t.sol -vvvv
```

## Results

```text
[PASS] test_transferBeneficiaryToManager_permanentlyTraps()
Position 6389066 permanently trapped; record = 0x17425c9E2e4F2Ef88736E9Df578C169153444dA4
trapped liquidity 4931840511012221
```

| Attempt after the self-transfer | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Former beneficiary: collect / decrease / close / withdraw / handover / requestRelease | `NotBeneficiary(alice, manager)` |
| Owner: `rescueNft` | `NftStillManaged` |
| Owner: `releaseNft` | `ReleaseNotRequested` |
| NPM `ownerOf(id)` | still the V3 manager |
| Beneficiary record | equals the V3 manager |

The handover harvests and pays existing fees first (so `tokensOwed` is 0 afterward); the locked value is the position's remaining principal and future fees. The reported `liquidity` is not a token valuation and is not converted to a currency amount here.

## Impact

Permanent, unrecoverable loss of the caller's own managed position. No benefit to an attacker, no effect on other users or on manager-held balances.

## Recommendation

Reject the manager's own address as a beneficiary destination, in both halves, alongside the existing zero check:

```solidity
if (to == address(0) || to == address(this)) revert ZeroAddress();
```

Optionally also reject the NPM and posm addresses. Do **not** reject all contract recipients - smart-contract wallets are legitimate beneficiaries. Both deployments are immutable, so this is a next-deployment fix; in the interim, the app and integrators must never pass the manager's address to `transferBeneficiary`.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Acknowledged, Info. Only the sender is affected, and our app never calls `transferBeneficiary`. The next deployment rejects both manager addresses.
# [I-02] `onERC721Received` accepts a mint from any ERC721, and such NFTs cannot leave

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L837-L853`, `DeltaLadderManagerV4.sol#L803-L819`

## Summary

The NatSpec says the receiver "REVERTS on any other ERC721 so nothing can be accepted-but-stranded". It does for transfers, but a mint (`from == address(0)`) returns the selector before the caller is checked. So any ERC721 contract can `_safeMint` to a manager, and `rescueNft` can only move NPM and posm tokens, so the NFT is stuck.

## Finding Description

```solidity
function onERC721Received(address, address from, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata) external nonReentrant returns (bytes4) {
    if (from != address(0)) { ... }                    // transfers: caller checked
    return IERC721Receiver.onERC721Received.selector;  // mints: accepted from any contract
}
```

The NatSpec says the mint branch exists "so the custodial open paths, which receive freshly-minted NFTs, are never misread as deposits". It never serves that purpose. Both Uniswap position managers mint with plain `_mint` (NPM L156, posm L368 in the verified Base sources), which never calls the receiver. So the only callers that reach this branch are other ERC721 contracts.

This is not Known Issue 2. That issue covers NPM and posm NFTs sent to the wrong half, plus the docblock's wording about versions. This finding is about the mint branch accepting any contract.

## Attack Path

There is no attacker.

1. A third-party contract, such as an incentive program that rewards "the owner of the position", safe-mints an NFT to the manager.
2. The manager accepts it. `rescueNft(V3, ...)` and `rescueNft(V4, ...)` both revert, so the NFT has no way out.

## Impact

NFTs minted to the manager by third parties are lost. Managed positions are not affected.

## Likelihood

Low.

## Proof of Concept

`test/report/I02_ForeignMint.t.sol`

```solidity
contract RewardNft is ERC721 {
    constructor() ERC721("Reward", "RWD") {}

    function safeMint(address to, uint256 id) external {
        _safeMint(to, id);
    }
}

contract I02_ForeignMint is ReportBase {
    function test_I02_foreignMintStranded() public {
        RewardNft nft = new RewardNft();
        address holder = _actor("holder");

        // A transfer of a foreign NFT is refused, as documented.
        nft.safeMint(holder, 1);
        vm.prank(holder);
        vm.expectRevert(DeltaLadderManagerV3.UnknownNft.selector);
        nft.safeTransferFrom(holder, address(MGR3), 1);

        // A mint of the same foreign NFT is accepted by both managers.
        nft.safeMint(address(MGR3), 2);
        nft.safeMint(address(MGR4), 3);
        assertEq(nft.ownerOf(2), address(MGR3));
        assertEq(nft.ownerOf(3), address(MGR4));

        // rescueNft only addresses the NPM and the posm, so the NFT cannot leave.
        vm.startPrank(OWNER);
        vm.expectRevert();
        MGR3.rescueNft(DeltaLadderManagerV3.Version.V3, 2, OWNER);
        vm.expectRevert();
        MGR3.rescueNft(DeltaLadderManagerV3.Version.V4, 2, OWNER);
        vm.stopPrank();
        assertEq(nft.ownerOf(2), address(MGR3));
    }
}
```

```text
[PASS] test_I02_foreignMintStranded()
```

## Recommendation

Reject mints. This is safe because neither position manager calls the hook when it mints:

```solidity
if (from == address(0)) revert UnknownNft();
```

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Acknowledged, Info. Neither Uniswap position manager calls the receiver when it mints, so the next deployment rejects mints and fixes the comment.
# [I-03] The V3 pause cannot stop top-ups, because V3 top-ups go straight to the Uniswap NPM

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L111`, `DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L533`, `DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L843`

## Summary

`openPaused` is documented as stopping all new capital: "opens, deposits and top-ups revert". The V4 half enforces this in `topUpV4`. The V3 half cannot: a V3 top-up is a call to Uniswap's `NonfungiblePositionManager.increaseLiquidity`, which anyone can call on any position, including the ones the manager holds. While V3 is paused, the app's V3 top-up flow keeps adding capital to positions in its custody.

## Finding Description

**Security property.** While `openPaused` is set, no new capital enters custody. Invariant 2 (L111), the `openPaused` NatSpec (L184) and the `OpensPaused` NatSpec (L357-358) all name top-ups.

**Root cause.** The manager can check the pause only in its own entry points, `openV3` (L533) and `onERC721Received` (L843). A V3 top-up never reaches them: the NPM's `increaseLiquidity` checks only the deadline (Base NPM L198-202), while decrease, collect and burn require `isAuthorizedForToken`. The code already relies on this path: "A V3 top-up needs no manager function, since the NPM's `increaseLiquidity` is permissionless" (L207-208).

This is not Known Issue 1, which is about the two halves pausing in separate transactions. This gap remains after both halves are paused.

## Attack Path

There is no attacker; this is the app's normal flow.

1. The owner pauses the V3 half during an incident.
2. `openV3` and NFT deposits revert with `OpensPaused`.
3. A user tops up a managed V3 position, which calls `NPM.increaseLiquidity`.
4. The liquidity lands in a position held by the paused manager.

## Impact

No loss on its own: the added liquidity belongs to the position's beneficiary, who can withdraw it at any time. The cost is that the pause does not do what it says on the V3 half: during an incident in the V3 manager, users keep moving capital into it, and a loss needs that separate incident. The contract cannot gate the NPM, so the remedy is in the frontend and the NatSpec.

## Likelihood

Every V3 pause, unless the frontend checks `openPaused` before offering a V3 top-up.

## Proof of Concept

`test/report/I05_V3PauseTopUp.t.sol`: one test on a Base fork at block 53,225,979, against the live V3 manager `0x17425c9e2e4f2ef88736e9df578c169153444da4` and V4 manager `0xc774edbeaf3e190b8fe9b9ebc753b58408949430`. With both halves paused, `openV3` and `topUpV4` revert, while a V3 top-up through the NPM still enters custody.

```solidity
contract I05_V3PauseTopUp is ReportBase {
    function test_I05_v3PauseDoesNotStopTopUps() public {
        address alice = _actor("alice");

        // Alice holds a managed V3 position and a managed V4 position.
        (address pool, address t0, address t1) = _v3Pool();
        uint256 id3 = _openV3(alice, pool, t0, t1);
        uint256 id4 = _openV4Native(alice, _v4NativePool(address(new TToken("C"))));

        // Incident response: the owner pauses both halves.
        vm.startPrank(OWNER);
        MGR3.setOpenPaused(true);
        MGR4.setOpenPaused(true);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Every manager entry point for new capital is closed, including the V4 top-up.
        IDeltaPositionBuilder.Rung[] memory r = new IDeltaPositionBuilder.Rung[](1);
        r[0] = IDeltaPositionBuilder.Rung(-600, 600, 1e18, 1e18, 0, 0);
        vm.prank(alice);
        vm.expectRevert(DeltaLadderManagerV3.OpensPaused.selector);
        MGR3.openV3(pool, r, 0, type(uint160).max, DL);

        uint128[] memory max = new uint128[](1);
        max[0] = 1e18;

        // The V3 top-up is a call to the NPM, which never reaches the manager.
        uint128 before = _liqV3(id3);
        _fund(t0, alice, 7e18);
        _fund(t1, alice, 7e18);
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        IERC20(t0).approve(address(NPM), type(uint256).max);
        IERC20(t1).approve(address(NPM), type(uint256).max);
        NPM.increaseLiquidity(INonfungiblePositionManager.IncreaseLiquidityParams(id3, 7e18, 7e18, 0, 0, DL));
        vm.stopPrank();

        assertTrue(MGR3.openPaused());
        assertEq(IERC721(address(NPM)).ownerOf(id3), address(MGR3));
        assertGt(_liqV3(id3), before, "capital entered V3 custody while paused");
        console2.log("liquidity added to a managed V3 position while paused:", uint256(_liqV3(id3) - before));

## Recommendation

- Make the frontend read `openPaused` before building a V3 top-up, and note in the incident runbook that the on-chain pause does not cover V3 top-ups.
- Correct the NatSpec (invariant 2, `openPaused`, `OpensPaused`) to say V3 top-ups are not covered.

# [I-04] V3 close/decrease fee split can miss fees when `tokensOwed` wraps

## Severity

Informational

## Location

`DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L711`, `DeltaLadderManagerV3.sol#L763`

**Affected code:** `DeltaLadderManagerV3._decreaseV3` and `_closeFees`

The V3 NPM exposes `tokensOwed0/1` as `uint128`. During a decrease, the manager uses the `uint256` principal returned by `decreaseLiquidity` together with that narrowed owed counter to separate principal from fees. If principal plus fees exceeds the `uint128` range and the counter wraps to a value no greater than principal, `_closeFees` returns zero. The manager then applies no protocol cut to the collected fees.

This affects the close/decrease path that uses `_decreaseV3`; fee-only collection uses balance deltas and is not affected by this split.

**Recommendation:** Account for accrued fees independently before decreasing liquidity, or use a method that does not infer fee amounts from the combined, narrowed NPM owed counter. At minimum, treat `nominal <= principal` as an anomalous state and document the exit implications of rejecting it.

## Team Response

Acknowledged.

Acknowledged, but Info rather than Low. The wrap is in Uniswap's own owed counter, so Uniswap already pays out only the wrapped amount and the user loses about 2^128 units. The missed cut is minor next to that.
